          "dc:description": "Beginning with the No Child Left Behind federal legislation, states were required to use data to monitor and improve student achievement. For high schools, the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education chose End of Course Exams (EOC) to demonstrate levels of student achievement. The policy changed from school choice of paper-pencil or computer-based testing to mandated computer-based testing. This study examined whether this decision best demonstrates the level of student mastery. Using high school EOC test scores for United States Government exams as the independent variable and high school cumulative grade point average (CGPA) as the dependent variable, the study examined the correlation between CGPA and computer-based (CBT) versus paper-pencil (PPT) modes of testing. Random samples from two comparable school districts were used to provide data. School A tested using computers, while school B used paper-pencil testing. Data presented in this study demonstrate there is little relationship between CGPA and EOC scores depending upon the mode of test administration. For the most part, the null hypotheses were not rejected. Results indicated limited support in some subgroups for the alternative hypotheses that students with a 2.5 or higher cumulative grade point average will score higher on end of course paper-pencil tests, while students with less than a 2.5 cumulative grade point average will score higher on end of course computer-based tests. Results of this study call into question whether the state and school districts should allow students choice of test mode or perhaps even require students to take the test using the mode of administration their cumulative grade point average indicates would demonstrate their actual level of achievement. This study also questions whether other high stakes tests such as the ACT, SAT, TOEFL, and LSAT, should determine mode of administration based on students' CGPA. Finally with the push for data driven classroom curriculum assessment, should the results of this study be applied to the need for differentiation in the classroom with regard to assessments.

          "dc:description": "Although there has been much published research on the benefits of distributed practice (Cepeda, Pashler, Vul, Wixted, \u0026amp; Rohrer, 2006) and the testing effect (Eisenkraemer, Jaeger, \u0026amp; Stein, 2013), very few studies are available regarding cumulative testing in college courses. Those available show a benefit to cumulative testing (Lawrence, 2014; Rohm, Sparzo, \u0026amp; Bennett, 1986; Szpunar, McDermott, \u0026amp; Roediger, 2007). As baseline information for a future study of cumulative testing, the current study investigated how well 150 college students recalled previous material when given unannounced cumulative items on a final exam. (Cumulative items were not counted toward students\u0026apos; grades.) Four sections of an undergraduate human development class formed the sample. Two professors taught two sections each and administered separately-developed exams throughout the semester. For the final exam, each professor chose ten multiple-choice items from each of the first and second tests of the semester to include on the final exam. The number of students missing the items on the final was compared to the number missing the same items earlier in the semester. A paired t-test showed a statistically significant increase in the overall number of students missing the items on the final exam. The size of the difference did not depend on whether the items were from Test 1 or Test 2, although it did differ by professor, with an effect size of 0.38 for Professor A and 1.15 for Professor B. A Pearson\u0026apos;s correlation between the overall number of students missing each item before and on the final was 0.51, indicating that items previously missed by larger numbers of students were not necessarily the ones missed by the most students on the final exam. This correlation differed by professor, as well (0.65 for Professor A; 0.45 for Professor B).",

          "dc:description": "In this exploratory study the researchers examined examine the value of exposure to the spelling and pronunciation of word forms when introducing the meanings of new and difficult vocabulary words. Researchers randomly assigned kindergarten English learners to one of two types of storybook reading delivered by tutors. Students received individual storybook reading. Students in both treatments listened to short stories containing novel target words. In both groups, students were told the meanings of the difficult words when they first appeared in the stories. However, in one of the groups (Definitions-Plus), students were also shown the printed words when they first appeared in the stories, and were asked to pronounce and spell the words aloud. Vocabulary learning was assessed with three researcher-designed measures including receptive vocabulary, vocabulary definitions, and spelling. Results showed that both groups made significant gains on all three custom measures, with average gains of 8%, 4%, and 3%, respectively. Moreover, the Definitions-Plus group had significantly greater spelling gains (d = 0.57), and exhibited similar, albeit nonsignificant, trends on vocabulary gains (ds = 0.30 and 0.41 for receptive and definitional vocabulary, respectively). Results extend previous studies' results to younger English learner students on general benefits of novel word exposure in story contexts, and specific benefits for spelling and pronunciation practice in learning new words. Two appendixes provide supplemental tables on \u0026quot;Target and Distractor Word Characteristics\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Story Characteristics.\u0026quot;",

          "dc:description": "Implementation of state and federal high-stakes accountability measures such as end-of-course tests (EoCTs) has contributed to increased teacher stress in the classroom, decreased teacher creativity and autonomy, and reduced effectiveness. Prior research focused primarily on the elementary and middle school levels, so this study sought to examine the perceptions of teachers at the secondary school level. The purpose of this qualitative, single-case study was to examine the perceptions of secondary teachers about the impact of performance-based accountability on their sense of efficacy. Driven by a social constructivist paradigm, the research question focused on the perceptions of 9 secondary teachers about the impact of performance-based accountability. Report card data, average yearly performance data, interview responses, and EoCT data for the 2011-2012 school year were collected. Inductive analysis was used to codify teachers\u0026apos; perceptions, which showed that an increased focus on test data negatively impacted teachers\u0026apos; sense of efficacy. Findings revealed 4 domains regarding teacher experiences: (a) increased stress, (b) increased frustration, (c) growing distrust of the test and the institutions surrounding the test, and (d) loss of respect for their professional judgment in their classrooms. This study calls into question the use of test data to evaluate teacher effectiveness. Findings may contribute to positive social change by informing the current debate on the use of test data in evaluating teachers, and highlighting research indicating that teachers with a greater sense of efficacy may be more effective in the classroom.

          "dc:description": "The primary purpose of this study was to provide quantitative data on the use of released Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) exams as benchmark test instruments in a sample population. Teachers have expressed concern over \u0026quot;teaching to the test,\u0026quot; especially with the use of benchmark testing. This study was specifically undertaken to determine the extent of this practice, especially in light of published material from Texas Education Agency (TEA) that states this practice is not an appropriate use of the released instrument. An additional purpose was to gain quantitative data on the use of data harvested from both benchmark administrations of TAKS instruments and actual TAKS administrations in decision-making. Related literature was reviewed at length to trace the history of the testing movement and conduct a detailed examination of its current context. District level supervisors/coordinators of English language arts from the North Central Texas area were chosen as the sample population for a brief survey questioning the use of released TAKS exams and the subsequent use of data harvested from those benchmark assessments, as well as the use of actual TAKS scores. Survey questions were developed and tested for validity and reliability before being sent to the survey pool of 75 educators from districts in a target area having a combined student population of 625, 797 according to TEA enrollment reports. The response rate was 52%. The survey was administered via SurveyMonkey(TM), and data were gathered and analyzed using descriptive statistics to establish quantitative terms on the use of the practices, and also using inferential statistics through SPSS, specifically using chi square tests and a Fisher's Exact Test to determine if there was a relationship between school district composition and the use of these practices. The test also contained two open-ended questions allowing for more elaboration. The percentage of respondents who indicated that their districts used released TAKS tests as benchmark instruments was 68.3%, with 80.5% disaggregating the data from both these administrations and actual TAKS tests. That number rose to 98.6% when adding those who said they only disaggregated data occasionally. Only 1.0% of respondents said they never disaggregated TAKS data. However, not quite half (47.5%) said their districts always or frequently used TAKS data alone to make important decisions regarding student interventions. Slightly more than one-third (37.5%) indicated that the results of a benchmark exam had an impact on district instructional/curricular decisions. Over half (52%) indicated their districts used the released TAKS exams in full scale rehearsals that significantly interrupted the school day to prepare for actual administration. Additionally, the respondents expressed their main concerns for the transition from TAKS to STAAR. The implication is more districts are using multiple data sources to inform their data-driven applications, even though many districts utilize released TAKS exams as benchmark instruments. Further research is suggested regarding the assessment literacy of educators, particularly in relation to the use of a summative test for harvesting diagnostic data as Texas transitions to the new STAAR/EOC exams.

          "dc:description": "This study included a literature review of juried research studies of student achievement factors that affect African American achievements tracked in the No Child Left Behind Legislative Act. Statistical correlation analyses were performed to determine if the absence or presence of one or two-parents in the household affected student achievement of the characteristic \u0026quot;exurban\u0026quot; research study public school district. The exurban public school district studied achieved Adequate Yearly Progress in every single one of its schools in 2009. The study was focused on the school district because of the existence of exurban African American household student population study groups for comparative data analyses in the residential research study setting. The study sought to determine if those African American subgroup household sizes were correlative for higher or lower achievement in student reading test scores when compared to long standing national African American Achievement gap evidenced in the National Assessment of Educational Progress and which has remained persistent. The study also examined the norm referenced Iowa Test of Basic Skills in peer household size \u0026quot;intra comparative\u0026quot; population study groups in reading achievement scores for national percentile ranking scores of exurban African American students' achievement for correlative effect. The research study groups matriculated in an extant exurban setting of a southeastern American public school district some 40 miles outside the major metropolitan area of Atlanta, Georgia. The study's findings revealed an \u0026quot;absent or minimal African American achievement gap\u0026quot; in most cases of the reading achievement NPR scores of exurban African American students. The study failed to reject all three of the null hypotheses with no statistically significant correlations using the Pearson Product Moment correlation among parent household size and reading achievement scores. However, an ANOVA test for the students' mean National Percentile Reading scores based on four population groups was significant (p = 0.001). The mean NPR for the two groups of gifted/advanced education students were found to be at least 30 points higher than for the two groups of regular education students in the exurban school district studied.

          "dc:description": "While some African American students perform as well as or better than their White peers on standardized tests, African Americans as a group attain lower scores on standardized tests than their White peers. This phenomenon has been addressed extensively in educational research. However, not much empirical research has been conducted to investigate whether a complementary assessment, such as the clinical interview, would provide more information about African American students' mathematical knowledge than a standardized test. Qualitative clinical interview methodology was used to explore the performance of the student participants on the clinical interviews and on the standardized test as well as teacher feedback about these students' mathematical knowledge. Data were gathered from three main sources: clinical interviews, standardized test results, and teacher interviews. Data were coded to identify common themes that shed light on the research questions. Most of the students performed better on specific items from the standardized assessment, the New Jersey Proficiency Assessment of State Standards (NJPASS), than on the clinical interview items. The scores on both assessments revealed much disparity among participants' mathematical competencies. The clinical interviews affirmed or changed the teachers' opinions of their students. The information from the clinical interviews fostered discussion of pedagogical practices. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

Five preschoolers age-eligible to begin kindergarten the following school year participated. The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Fourth Edition (PPVT-4) and Expressive Vocabulary Test, Second Edition (EVT-2) were administered pre-intervention and post-intervention implementation. Consistent with multiple baseline design, all students received weekly progress monitoring using the Picture Naming (PN) Individual Growth and Development Indicator (IGDI) throughout the entire investigation. Caregivers received in-person video-based training in dialogic reading techniques. They were then directed to implement dialogic reading strategies within their homes when reading with their children a minimum of three times per week for fifteen minutes per session over a six-week intervention period. It was hypothesized that children receiving home-based dialogic reading support would demonstrate greater expressive and receptive vocabulary skills than those participating in preschool program alone. Visual analysis of graphic data within conditions and between adjacent conditions was utilized to analyze the research questions. Results of the study supported the hypotheses but did not confirm them. Children who received home-based dialogic reading support demonstrated expressive and receptive vocabulary skill growth but no abrupt change occurred immediately after introducing the dialogic reading intervention.

          "dc:description": "In 1997, based on the amendments to Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), all states were faced with a statutory requirement to develop and implement alternate assessments for students with disabilities unable to participate in the statewide large-scale assessment. States were given the challenge of creating, implementing, and executing these tests within a short period of three years. In most cases, innovative assessments were developed by tweaking, combining and modifying traditional assessments already in place for non-disabled students. When changes were made to the traditional assessment program, the psychometric properties associated with the test and scores are likely to differ due to the unique characteristics of the student population and testing program. However, few changes had been made to the traditional analyses of scores of students with disabilities. This study examines the impact of changes to three psychometric elements--design, examinee population and analysis issues on ability and item estimates from the assessment computed using Rasch measurement model. Using data from a statewide selected response alternate assessment designed for students with disabilities in southern United States, the impact of test design and analysis decisions related to partial credit scoring, analyses within homogeneous groups and treatment of lead questions were examined to determine the effect on test outcomes. We examined estimates of item difficulty and ability as well as a select sample of items and students' scores to compare them to estimates from \u0026quot;original\u0026quot; analyses. The results indicated considerable variability of student scores and differential impacts on item measures based on the choices or a combination of choices made during analyses. Clear patterns of change in scores when the lead questions were treated as correct seem to suggest a systemic change in item measures. High correlations between student scores from the homogeneous and the heterogeneous group analyses indicated little difference between the two. The findings in this study provided evidence for building validity evidence for an assessment, decisions made in computing psychometric measures need to be explicitly based on theory and aligned to the use and the interpretations of scores.

          "dc:description": "The current state of health of the United States, including physical inactivity, dietary intake, and overall lifestyle habits is of concern for educators. Specifically, the health of the college population appears to be under-represented in health and wellness research. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a 15-week university wellness-based course on health indicators and six dimensions of wellness: physical, psychological, emotional, intellectual, social, and spiritual. The researcher hypothesized that students who participated in the wellness-based course (intervention group) would experience positive health outcomes and increased perceptions of wellness in the six areas of wellness. The intervention group consisted of 66 students (72.4% male). The control group had 58 students 57.6 male). Both groups completed pre-test and post-test health assessments (body mass index, body composition, resting heart rate, blood pressure). The Perceived Wellness Survey (PWS) was used for pre-test and post-test measures for perceived levels of wellness in the six dimensions. During the 15-week semester, the intervention group received wellness education following a curriculum that reviewed all areas of wellness and had an online physical activity tracking component. Statistical analyses for two of the five health indicators in the intervention group showed significant changes; body mass index (p \u0026lt; 0.01, t = -2.21) and resting heart rate (p \u0026lt; 0.001, t = 3.31). Perceived wellness scores from pre- to post-test were statistically significant in the intervention group for all six dimensions of wellness (p \u0026lt; 0.001): psychological health (t = -7.28), emotional (t = -4.36), social (t = -3.90), physical (t = -3.38), spiritual (t = -5.56), and intellectual (t = -7.21). Additionally, post-test wellness scores for the intervention group were significantly higher than the control group (p \u0026lt; 0.01, p \u0026lt; 0.001) in all six dimensions of wellness. The study findings provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of wellness education on the six areas of wellness for college students. The study provides a foundation for future research to evaluate the need for campus wellness initiatives and wellness-based education. In conclusion, university administrators and educators should consider the inclusion of wellness credits into the general education requirements to enhance wellness and encourage a holistic lifestyle that fosters academic success.

A revised and improved version of Jaleh Shabahang's (1993) \u0026quot;International Education Opinionnaire\u0026quot; was used to survey American students and faculty regarding their perceptions of the educational and cultural impact of international students. The revised instrument also measured American student and faculty perceptions of five ethnic groups of international students. Three independent samples t-tests were administered to compare the views between two American groups: students or faculty in international-related academic departments (IRs) and non-international-related academic departments (NIRs). The first test examined the average difference in perceived educational impact of international students. The second test examined the difference in perceived cultural impact of international students. The third test examined the relative standing of five ethnic groups of international students between White, Non-Hispanic and Non-White participants. Data analysis revealed that there were no significant differences between American students or faculty from IRs and NIRs on the first and second tests. The data analysis also revealed no significant differences between White, Non-Hispanic and Non-White American students or faculty regarding their attitudes toward the five ethnic groups of international students. American students and faculty from both kinds of academic departments at the Appalachian University mostly agreed or strongly agreed on the positive educational and cultural contributions of international students. In terms of perceptions, the third independent samples t-test showed that Middle Eastern and Hispanic students ranked the lowest.

          "dc:description": "The Wyoming Department of Education (WDE) has invested time and money developing standardized achievement test score reports designed to give teachers data about each of their students' levels of mastery of particular concepts in order to differentiate their instruction. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which eighth-grade mathematics teachers used Traffic Signal Project Reports to analyze how teachers used data to differentiate instruction. A qualitative case study methodology was used in gathering data from teachers of similar backgrounds and school settings. This study focused on three research questions including how teachers used Traffic Signal Project Reports to inform their instruction, how teachers differentiated their instruction based on assessment data, and how teachers decided which sources of data they used to make instructional changes in the classroom. A panel of experts, seventh- and eighth-grade Wyoming math teachers, analyzed a set of interview questions and determined that they were adequate for the purpose of the case study. Questions focused on whether teachers used Traffic Signal Project Reports and/or other types of data to shape their instruction. The population of this study was middle school mathematics teachers located in Wyoming. Ten eighth-grade mathematics teachers from Title I schools and schools with similar demographics participated in the study. Results from the study showed that standardized test score data were used mostly for grouping students in classes by ability rather than used for differentiating instruction within the classroom. Also, teachers were more comfortable using their own classroom data pieces to differentiate instruction in the classroom rather than standardized achievement test score data. Furthermore, teachers utilized various forms of data to make instructional decisions such as class groupings or adjusting curriculum. The majority of the teachers either implied or stressed the need to utilize multiple sources of data before making instructional decisions. The teachers also indicated that the Traffic Signal Project Reports should be modified to make them more user-friendly for differentiation.

          "dc:description": "With the recent addition of engineering to most K-12 testable state standards, efficient and comprehensive instruments are needed to assess changes in student knowledge and perceptions of engineering. In this study, I developed the Students\u0026apos; Awareness and Perceptions of Learning Engineering (STAPLE) instrument to quantitatively measure fourth through eighth grade students\u0026apos; knowledge of, interest in, and efficacy toward engineering. STAPLE was developed using four samples for four separate analyses: content expert review (n = 15), field-test (n = 40), pilot-test (n = 576), and confirmatory test (n = 1,007). Content experts had expertise in either engineering education or gifted education. Students in grades four through eight completed the field-test, pilot-test, and confirmatory test. Item Response Theory (IRT) analysis was used to analyze the dichotomous knowledge items, while factor analysis was used to analyze the six-point scaled interest and efficacy items. IRT analysis of the knowledge items revealed that seven items should be removed from STAPLE in order for the instrument to yield reliable results. Factor analysis on the interest and efficacy items revealed three factors: Interest in Engineering, Efficacy toward Engineering Global and Social Dynamics, and Efficacy toward Engineering Process and Design. Fit statistics were adequate for each of the factors. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that male students had higher mean factor scores for Interest in Engineering and Efficacy toward Engineering, while female students had higher factor scores for Efficacy toward Engineering Global and Social Dynamics. Additionally, students identified as gifted had higher factor scores for Engineering Global and Social Dynamics; however, students not identified as gifted had higher factor scores for Interest in Engineering and Efficacy toward Engineering Process and Design. These results have implications for engineering instruction and interventions. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

          "dc:description": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of the SuccessMaker (SM) program along with teacher instruction and skill development on the academic performance of fourth grade students. School personnel are searching for efficient and effective means for improving instruction and knowledge. Instructional technology can be very beneficial to improving student achievement. With this awareness and the demands to meet Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP), caused by No Child Left Behind, schools and districts have increased the pressure to find instructional technology applications that advance student learning. Fourth grade students from an elementary school in South Carolina who completed the SM program in the 2009-10 school year were studied. Data was gathered from this year. Descriptive statistics and independent samples t-test were utilized to analyze this data. The population consisted of 90 students who were assigned to coursework in the Reader's Workshop (RW) and Math Concepts and Skills (MCS) courseware in SM. Palmetto Assessment of State Standards (PASS), the state-mandated measurement of AYP, was utilized to measure achievement. A quantitative research method with a simple descriptive research design was employed to answer the research questions and test the hypotheses. The first research question focused on time in the program. The second and third questions examined the combined effects of both RW and MCS on achievement scores. Findings indicated that students who maintained the performance level in SM with 65% or higher for reading and 90% or higher for mathematics scored significantly higher on PASS when compared to students who performed 64% or lower and 89% or lower. However, time in the SM program was not effective in showing an increase in PASS test scores.. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

          "dc:description": "Current CAT applications consist of predominantly dichotomous items, and CATs with polytomously scored items are limited. To ascertain the best approach to polytomous CAT, a significant amount of research has been conducted on item selection, ability estimation, and impact of termination rules based on polytomous IRT models. Few studies investigated the optimal pool characteristics for polytomous CAT implementation. Using the generalized partial credit model (GPCM) (Muraki, 1992), this study aims to identify an optimal item pool design for tests with polytomous items by extending the p-optimality method (Reckase, 2007). The extension includes the definition of atheta-bin to describe polytomous items succinctly for pool design, and item generation strategy using constrained nonlinear optimization method. Optimal item pools are generated using CAT simulations with and without practical constraints. The item pool characteristics under each condition are summarized and their performance is evaluated against an extended operational item pool. The results indicated that the practical constraints of the a-stratified exposure control and content balancing do not affect pool size to a large extent. However, the a-stratified control affects the pool characteristics greatly: the items included in the simulated pools with the control have larger a-parameter and provide higher maximum information on average. On the other hand, the content balancing applied in this study has little impact on pool design. The evaluation results of the pool performance are closely related to the pool characteristics. When the a-stratified exposure control applied, the consistent results include: 1) the average test information is lower than that without the constraint; 2) RMSE is higher and the correlation between the true and estimated abilities is lower; 3) the percentage of the correct classification for the highest achievement level is lower. However, for all the simulated optimal pools, while the test information is consistently above the target level 10.0, it is concluded that the a-stratified method resulted in an efficient use of less discriminative items with small decreases in measurement precision. With regard to the item pool usage, the percentage of items that are fully used, well used, rarely used, and never used are quite comparable for the pools designed with constraints. However, compared with the extended operational pool, when the a-stratified method applied, the conditional test overlap rate of the simulated pools is consistently lower. For the pool blueprint, because the normal ability distribution is assumed, more items are included in the middle of the ability scale for all simulated optimal pools. The distributions of the a- and b- parameters are similar under all conditions. When the a-stratified method applied, there are fewer items in the first stratum and the number of items in the second and third stratum is nearly identical. In addition, with the content balancing control, the number of items in the first content area is slightly less than the second one.

Classroom teachers rated each student's attentive behavior in a whole-class setting and tutors rated each student's attentive behavior in an intensive small-group setting. The sample was 131 fourth-grade students identified as at risk for developing mathematics difficulties (MD) and randomly assigned to fraction tutoring. Teachers and tutors rated each student's inattentive behavior in the 10th week of the 12-week intervention period. On average, tutors rated students as more attentive than teachers. Also, tutor ratings had greater predictive power than teacher ratings on fraction concepts, but neither set of ratings uniquely predicted performance on whole-number calculations. Possible explanations for findings and directions for future research are discussed. [Note: This content is a pre-print version of the article.]",

          "dc:description": "Education has continued to follow a traditional teaching model which may not prepare students with needed workforce skills. Social networking has been viewed as a technology tool useful for enhancing communication at both the business and educational level. The theory of connectivism underscores the need for social group interaction to provide meaning. The research questions for this quantitative study involved exploration of the potential connection between social networking and increased literacy skills. 32 public school teachers of one school district provided survey information that included the amount of social networking students used in the classroom. Regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between social networking time per teacher, teacher age, years of experience teaching, and their students' state mandated reading test scores. Increased time on social networking assignments and teacher experience predicted reading test scores. Results suggest that social networking in school is a worthwhile endeavor to bring relevance to students and increase their literacy skills. One implication for positive social change is shifting the national educational pedagogy to include additional technology training for students. A second implication for positive social change is using the results to improve students' technology and literacy skills to help them compete successfully in a global economy.

          "dc:description": "At one high school, the goal for nonproficient reading students was to score at or above the 50th percentile to meet adequate yearly progress objectives. In 2010, the performance levels of nonproficient reading students tested with the state reading test in Grades 9 and 10 declined from the 47th to the 46th percentile. The purpose of this research was to examine the effect of the questioning-as-thinking framework on comprehension levels in a high school setting and to test the intervention by comparing the results to a control group reading comprehension levels. The results provided data to administration to assess the needs of nonproficient students and the strategies they received to increase student learning. In the one-group pre- and posttest design, 75 Grade 11 and 12 students received questioning-as-thinking instructional strategies consisting of think-alouds, question-answer relationships, and self-questioning over a 9-week period. The repeated-measures, within-subjects ANOVA design assessed each questioning-as-thinking metacognition instructional strategy implemented in the study. The findings indicated a significant difference in reading comprehension for question-answer-relationship and self-questioning strategies but not for the think-aloud strategy. Comparison of treatment and control groups showed no statistical differences in reading comprehension. The implication for positive social change includes understanding better the strategies that effectively improve reading comprehension among high school students.

The purpose of this study was to determine the following: 1) are postconventional stages of ego development evidenced in school superintendents; 2) do the number of years in career as superintendent relate to later stages of ego development; and 3) are there significant themes belonging to superintendents in the same stage of ego development as they describe what is valuable and important to them when discussing school policy and decision-making. Three stages of ego development [Expert (3/4), Achiever (4), Individualist (4/5)] were identified in this sample. More number of career years as a superintendent did not suggest later stages of ego development. Themes related to what superintendents described as important and valuable when discussing school policy and decision-making emerged in each of the ego stages identified by the Sentence Completion Test-Leadership Maturity Framework (SCTi-MAP) assessment.

Suggested strategies to remedy this situation include quizzes (Ruscio, 2001; Ryan, 2006), study worksheets (Aagaard \u0026amp; Skidmore, 2009; Ryan, 2006), shorter reading assignments and use of the textbook during class time (Aagaard \u0026amp; Skidmore, 2009). A convenient cluster sample of 105 undergraduate students at a regional university in the midsouth completed a survey regarding their use of college textbooks, what strategies might increase the likelihood of their reading textbook assignments, and their preference for how class time was used. Participants were 60% female and fairly evenly distributed across the four years of college experience. Chi-square was run on 25 selected comparisons, with a Bonferroni correction of the resulting alphas. A majority of students (52%) reported that they do read the assigned textbook readings. Freshmen were significantly more likely to report that outside reading should not be required, and less likely to report having used or known about e-textbooks. Strategies reported to most likely prompt reading the textbook included in-class quizzes over text material (73% overall, but females were significantly more likely to read because of quizzes), assigning graded study-guides to complete while reading (77%); testing over material found in the textbook but not covered in class (81%); and assigning shorter reading assignments (77%). Sixty-four percent of respondents overall preferred group presentations, but sophomores and seniors opted for individual work, while juniors preferred groups. Additionally, students reported preferring the use of PowerPoint lectures to notes on the chalkboard, and generally preferred the use of group discussion and application of material to real-life rather than just lecture over textbook content. Textbook and Use of Class Time Survey results are appended.",

The purpose of this study was to illuminate the impact of Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) Academy programs on students\u0026apos; academic performance. The theoretical foundation of the research was based on Bronfenbrenner\u0026apos;s ecological system theory, which holds that a child\u0026apos;s environment can affect his or her development and success. A pretest-posttest nonequivalent control group design was employed to compare the biology and literature End of Course Test (EOCT) scores for 9th grade JROTC students and students from a traditional small school learning community. Research questions determined if there were significant differences between the groups\u0026apos;s biology and literature EOCT scores, controlling for differences in pretest scores. Data were analyzed using Analysis of Covariance. Significant differences were found between JROTC academy students\u0026apos; and traditional students\u0026apos; EOCT biology scores. These results suggest that the JROTC academy concept might be useful in other urban environments with a high percentage of at-risk students. Positive social change could occur from this study by informing educators of the utility of the Junior ROTC academy concept for enhancing students\u0026apos; social development and academic achievement.

Using data from the ACT, the National Student Clearinghouse, and the \u0026quot;College Possible\u0026quot; program, researchers examined the impact of the program on ACT scores, college applications, and college enrollment. The study meets WWC group design standards with reservations. Overall college enrollment rates were the same in both groups (about 64%). Students in the intervention group enrolled in selective institutions at a higher rate than students in the comparison group (12% vs. 5%), but this difference was not statistically significant. The author did report that the proportion of students enrolling in a 4-year institution was higher for the intervention group (45% vs. 34%), but the WWC found that this effect was not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. The regression discontinuity (RD) design portion of this study did not meet WWC RD standards because the forcing variable does not have a sufficient number of unique values.

          "dc:description": "The primary purpose of this study was to validate a method for assessing Morphological Awareness (MA) using multimorphemic words commonly used in the academic and clinical practice settings of physical therapy. The Medical Morphology Test (MMT) was developed for this study and was compared to scores on the Nelson-Denny Reading Test (NDRT©). The NDRT© has previously been shown to be a predictor of both academic performance and performance on the National Physical Therapy Examination (NPTE). A secondary purpose of the study was to determine if the MMT could be used as a predictor of academic performance as measured by Grade Point Average (GPA) or to predict number of attempts to pass the NPTE. Pearson Correlations were used to compare scores on the NDRT© and MMT. Regression analysis was used to determine the predictive value of the MMT for academic performance and performance on the NPTE. Participants for this study consisted of 32 alumni of a single physical therapy program. Thirty of the participants completed both the NDRT© and MMT, two did not complete the NDRT©. Twenty-one of the participants had passed the NPTE© on the first attempt. Eleven of the subjects required between two and seven attempts to pass the NPTE. Results from this study found that there was a statistically significant relationship between scores on the MMT and NDRT©. Scores on the MMT were able to predict GPA and classify participants as members of a group who passed the NPTE on the first attempt or not, but scores on the MMT were not able to predict the actual number of attempts to pass the NPTE©.

          "dc:description": "The Instant Word Notebook study was a program evaluation completed by two educators who saw a need for an instructional tool to teach and assess Instant Words. In order to address reading deficits of students in first and second grades, teachers were expected to teach Instant Words. Unfortunately, teachers did not have a systematic process to teach and assess Instant Words for mastery. The two educators of this study responded to the teachers' need for an instructional tool by creating The Instant Word Notebook. The Notebook was used by teachers to teach and assess Instant Words to first and second grade students with the anticipation of reading scores increasing. In order to measure the impact of The Instant Word Notebook on Instant Word recognition and reading achievement, the collaborative team completed a process and outcome evaluation of The Instant Word Notebook. In this outcome evaluation, the outcome investigator completed a Comparative Analysis of The Instant Word Notebook. Measurements utilized to determine the impact of The Instant Word Notebook were the scores from the Gates MacGinitie Reading pretests and posttests and the scores from the Instant Word Recognition pretests and posttests. Information from each test was utilized by the outcome investigator to identify the impact of The Instant Word Notebook on reading achievement and Instant Word recognition. This quantitative study focused especially on the mean difference between the treatment and control groups. The treatment group received six weeks of explicit instruction of Fry's 300 Instant Words. In contrast, the control group received the normal Instant Word instruction from their teachers. The outcome investigator compared the mean difference between the control and treatment groups to determine statistical significance of The Instant Word Notebook. The improvement in scores from the pretests to the posttests validated the use of The Instant Word Notebook as an instructional tool to improve sight word recognition.

          "dc:description": "Underachieving gifted students, described by Gowan (1955) as \u0026quot;one of the greatest social wastes in our culture,\u0026quot; are a challenge to educational stakeholders and a loss to society. Gifted children, who are often identified at an early age, possess unique talents and abilities that set them apart from their peers. Young gifted children are highly inquisitive, learn to read early, have extensive vocabularies, and think abstractly. When placed in an academically stimulating and nurturing environment, the abilities of young gifted children can be monitored and developed. However, when gifted students underachieve, their potential to contribute their unique insight, different perspective, and unparalleled thinking is impacted. The idea that the intellectually gifted will self-sustain academically is a common misconception found in schools and educational settings today. The purposes of this study were to determine if underachievement exists at the elementary school level, discover the onset of underachievement, and identify patterns of underachievement in elementary gifted students. The underachievement of students was determined by examining the archival data that included report card grades and the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) reading and mathematics performance over a five year period. The existing data of students who were identified in their 1st grade year as Gifted and Talented (GT) were analyzed to discover the onset of underachievement. Additionally, attendance data were examined, to identify patterns of underachievement. Descriptive statistics revealed that students experienced semesters of academic underachievement in the elementary school years. The descriptive statistics also indicated that some gifted students experienced an onset of underachievement as early as second grade. Statistical significance was found in the duration of underachievement between gifted achievers and gifted underachievers. Statistical significant differences were also found in the TAKS Reading and Mathematics scale scores of gifted achievers and gifted underachievers. No statistical significance was found in the attendance patterns of gifted students. The results of this research suggest that underachievement begins at the elementary level. It is important that educators monitor the achievement of students across the core subjects and consistently review students' performance on standardized assessments in hopes to prevent underachievement.

Because admission criteria play a crucial role in applicant selection, choosing students, that will successfully complete the program as well as the necessary credentialing exams, is a particularly crucial task for admission committees. The study had three elements. First, it investigated the relationship between the variables of age, undergraduate GPA and scores from the Psychological Services Bureau Health Occupations Aptitude Examination (PSB) and successful student performance on the NBDHE and a regional clinical exam, namely the Southern Regional Testing Agency. Second, it investigated the validity of the predictive value of the PSB entrance exam as one of the admission criteria for the selected program. Third, it investigated the strength of the relationship of age, undergraduate GPA, and PSB scores as a predictor of program completion and subsequent success on credentialing licensure exams. This study analyzed secondary data from an accredited dental hygiene program that awards an Associate's of Applied Science Degree in the mid-south United States. The results revealed a weak, if any, correlation between the candidate selection criteria and the subsequent outcomes on post-graduate credentialing exams. Age was a negative weak correlation, if any, for the dependent variable NBDHE with a Pearson Correlation value of r = -0.037 for the NBDHE and r = -0.142 for the SRTA clinical exam. Undergraduate GPA revealed a weak relationship to NBDHE scores with a Pearson Correlation of r = 0.312 and a negative weak relationship, if any, to the SRTA clinical exam scores with a Pearson Correlation of r = -0.050. The PSB score was a moderate predictor for NBDHE scores with a Pearson Correlation of r = 0.364. The PSB score however, was a negative weak predictor of SRTA clinical exam scores with a Pearson Correlation of r = -0.134.

A convenient cluster sample of 105 students taking summer classes at a regional university in the mid-south were administered a self-efficacy scale and a survey of textbook use and preferences for in-class activities. Frequency tables of study survey items by self-efficacy group (above vs. below the sample average) were produced and visually inspected for effect size prior to statistical testing. Subsequently, three chi-square tests were conducted with a Bonferroni correction to alpha, lowering it from 0.05 to 0.0167. The data collected supported the idea that students from high-poverty areas enter college with reduced academic self-efficacy, as the average for the entire sample was lower than other published data. Those evidencing below-average academic self-efficacy in this sample were significantly less likely to engage in the strategies that would help them be successful (such as reading their textbooks).",

          "dc:description": "Organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) is a social science construct defined by Organ (1988) as employee actions that are discretionary, not formally recognized or rewarded, and that are helpful to the effectiveness of the organization. This study explored part-time work as a base of OCB by investigating the relationship between this construct and organizational sense of belonging (OSB) as proffered by Quinn (2006) and Merriman (2010) among adjunct faculty at a two-year, Midwestern technical college. Teaching faculty, both full-time and adjunct, were sent an email explaining the study and containing an embedded hyperlink connecting them to an electronic survey. The instrument used to measure OCB was created by Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Moorman and Fetter (1990). Somers\u0026apos; (1999) BESR work/school subscale assessed OSB. There were 92 full-time and 77 adjunct faculty who participated in this study. Three research questions were examined and eight associated hypotheses tested. There was a statistically significant difference in the degree of OSB measured among full-time faculty when compared to the degree of OSB measured among adjunct faculty. The results of a two-tailed difference of means t-test accepted hypothesis one, t(100.15) = 2.31, p = 0.023, alpha = 0.05. This was an expected outcome as they have committed to make teaching their full-time occupation at this institution, and have greater opportunities to create and maintain connections with other employees that enhance their OSB (Baumeister \u0026amp; Leary, 1995). There was not a statistically significant difference in the degree of OCB measured among full-time faculty when compared to the degree of OCB measured among adjunct faculty. The results of a two-tailed difference of means t-test rejected hypothesis two, t(101.27) = 0.36, p = 0.723, alpha = 0.05. These results suggest that OCB can not necessarily be attributed solely to full-time workers; part-time employees have been shown to be equally likely to engage in OCB. This was an unexpected finding. However, since the mean scores of both groups are relatively high (M = 5.92 for full-time faculty and M = 5.85 for adjuncts on a scale of 1.0 to 7.0), it could be concluded that the faculty at the institution in this study exhibit a strong degree of extra-role behavior, regardless of employee class. Simple linear regression was utilized to analyze hypothesis three through eight, testing the model OCB = ß[subscript 0] + ß[subscript1](OSB) where OSB was the predictor variable for the criterion variable OCB (or one of the five dimensions of OCB) as proffered by Organ (1988). OSB was found to be a statistically significant linear predictor of the general OCB construct (F(1) = 29.57, p \u0026lt; 0.001, alpha = 0.05), and was found to be a significant linear predictor of the following dimensions of OCB: altruism (F[1] = 36.45, p \u0026lt; 0.001, alpha = 0.05), conscientiousness (F[1] = 8.51, p = 0.005, alpha = 0.05), and civic virtue (F[1] = 16.70, p \u0026lt; 0.001, alpha = 0.05). Since OCB is inherently beneficial and the hiring of these part-time workers has increased over the last few decades, it is fitting for college administrators to find ways to help them make connections at their institutions (Lee \u0026amp; Robbins, 1995; Quinn, 2006).

          "dc:description": "A recent law in a New England state allowed public schools to operate with increased flexibility and autonomy through the authorization of the creation of Innovation Schools. This project study, a program evaluation using a convergent parallel mixed methods research design, allowed for a comprehensive evaluation of the first Innovation School (IS). Activity theory, which conceptualizes change in systems involving human interaction, was the theoretical foundation of this study. The research questions focused on the efficacy of the autonomous school redesign model in involving stakeholders in participatory decision making, improving teacher collaboration, expanding teacher empowerment, and increasing student achievement on a state standardized assessment. Descriptive and statistical analyses of a preestablished survey on teacher empowerment were used to collect data, and student achievement was examined via parametric statistical analyses of standardized state achievement assessments of 3rd, 4th and 5th grade students. Independent and paired t-test analyses documented significant increases in teacher empowerment and student achievement test scores associated with the IS model. Qualitative data, focus group and individual interviews, were analyzed through open coding and deriving summative themes of stakeholder perceptions to extend the quantitative results. The combined findings demonstrated that the IS model significantly impacted teacher empowerment and student achievement. The implications for social change lies in giving stakeholders a voice and decision making authority. As a result, schools can become organizations where stakeholders, regardless of race, color, national origin, or educational attainment, become responsible for issues related to the teaching and learning of the entire school community.

          "dc:description": "Compliance with NCAA DI rules matters. The leaders of the NCAA, colleges and universities devise, negotiate and elect NCAA rules to address recurring problems. Despite these efforts, schools continue to violate NCAA rules. The objective intent of a rule is to affect a change in behavior; if behavior does not change, then the rule is ineffective. NCAA regulatory studies have determined that the NCAA selectively enforces its rules (Otto, 2006) and that compliance is explained as a result of economic, socio-cultural and institutional factors (Baxter \u0026amp; Lambert, 1991; Clark \u0026amp; Batista, 2009; Humphreys \u0026amp; Ruseski, 2006; Stern, 1979, 1981). However, there has not yet been a systematic study of NCAA regulation to understand the degree to which compliance is a result of NCAA rules. This dissertation aims to fill this gap in the literature by conducting an evaluation of NCAA DI rules against the use of recruiting inducements in men's basketball. This dissertation examines particular NCAA rules that target essentially the same issue (recruitment inducements) and ties essential features of these rules to direct outcomes. The public reports of NCAA major infractions cases from 1952 to 2010 were analyzed and data was collected on past compliance, self-reporting, penalties, and the actors cited for rules violations. A Mann-Whitney U Test was used to evaluate the effect of NCAA rule reforms on compliance; the results showed that the reforms led to no significant change in compliance. The trend analyses of compliance, self-reporting, penalties and cited actors provided real world outcomes to test theoretical propositions on compliance. The framework of compliance (Mitchell, 1994) was applied in this dissertation to evaluate how the frame and structure of rules influence compliance. The empirical and analytical findings of this dissertation support the following contentions: NCAA rules, and their attendant monitoring and enforcement systems, do not function to support compliance. NCAA rules that impose rights and obligations on actors who lack the power, ability or incentives to fulfill such responsibilities will be less successful in gaining compliance. Finally, this dissertation highlights the considerable influence of private actors and the institutional hierarchy of power on NCAA compliance.

          "dc:description": "The Academy was an assessment enhancement program created by the HLC to help institutions strengthen and improve the assessment of student learning. Using a multiple case study approach, this study applies Argyis and Schon\u0026apos;s (1976) Theory of Action to explore the espoused values and existence of Model I and II behavior characteristics. Argyis and Schon explained that a learning opportunity occurs as a result of an unintended consequence. Thus, the organizational characteristics, demonstrated through Model I and Model II descriptions, guide the organization\u0026apos;s response to the learning moment. Model I organizations tend to operate with unilateral agendas and exhibit defensive behavior. Model I behavior is most closely associated with single-loop learning, which focuses on fixing an immediate problem with action-oriented responses. Model II organizations seek to demonstrate transparency, shared ownership, and public testing of ideas and assumptions. Thus, Model II organizations typically demonstrate double-loop learning. Double-loop learning continuously questions, critiques, and tests the underlying values and assumptions that led to an error. Double-loop learning is most closely associated with continuous improvement and a culture based on evidence, both of which are values of the Academy. While Academy participants typically described Model II characteristics in their efforts, their actions often reflect characteristics associated with Model I. In this study, the researcher found evidence of Model II behavior, but most institutions tended to exhibit Model I behavior. Institutions generally espoused the intention to improve the involvement of faculty and administration in assessment. Furthermore, participants hoped to demonstrate improvement-oriented and accountability-oriented outcomes. Several factors contributed to the disconnect between espoused and enacted practices, including the institution\u0026apos;s rationale for joining the Academy; the success or momentum generated from pre-existing assessment initiatives; and the learning that is passed from an individual to the organization, especially at institutions with high administrative turnover. Institutions should have a general sense of their organizational characteristics because this allows stakeholders to test and possibly change practice. This study contributes to the growing research call for more strategies to promote double-loop learning. Institutions that engaged in collaborative processes, had leaders who championed assessment efforts, supported risk-taking, and distinguished mandates from improvement efforts were more likely to exhibit characteristics of Model II behavior.

          "dc:description": "The standards-based reform movement has resulted in the wide-spread use of summative assessments designed to measure students\u0026apos; performance at specific points in time. While many have hoped that these end-of-year tests would provide constructional useful information for educators, they do not. This is not because there is something \u0026quot;wrong\u0026quot; with these summative accountability tests, rather that they were not designed to meet instructional purposes. Recognizing the inherent limitations of summative assessment, educators are looking for additional assessments to inform and track student learning during the year. Large numbers of vendors are now selling what they call \u0026quot;benchmark,\u0026quot; \u0026quot;diagnostic,\u0026quot; and/or \u0026quot;predictive\u0026quot; assessments with promises of improving student performance. These systems often lay claim to the research documenting the powerful effect of formative assessment on student learning. However, the research in this area, including the seminal Black and Wiliam (1998) meta-analysis, evaluated formative assessments of a very different character than essentially all current commercially-available interim assessment programs. This policy brief provides a definition to differentiate between true classroom formative assessment and the interim assessments currently in the marketplace. It also describes a framework for understanding what purposes interim assessments can serve and considering their appropriate role in a comprehensive assessment system. The goal of this brief is to help district leaders thoughtfully examine the commercially-available interim assessment products, develop strong specifications for a customized system, develop their own interim assessments, or determine that interim assessments are not an appropriate tool for their assessment system. A second goal is to help state leaders consider what role they might play in supporting effective interim assessment practices. This policy brief is organized into the following seven sections: (1) Distinguishing among Assessment Types; (2) Questions to Start With; (3) Determining the Purpose for the Interim Assessment; (4) Characteristics of an Effective Interim Assessment System to Be Used for Instructional Purposes; (5) Current Commercially Available Interim Assessment Systems; (6) Implications for District and State Decision Makers; and (7) Conclusions.",

          "dc:description": "One public school district developed a full-day kindergarten program for at-risk students, including those who are limited English-proficient (LEP), as a strategy to close the achievement gap. Not all LEP students in this district attended the full-day program due to limited space. The district administrators were looking for research-based evidence on the effectiveness of this 4-year old program to determine if the program should shift to a universal, full-day kindergarten program. The purpose of this quantitative, post facto design study was to examine the effect of attending a full-day and a half-day kindergarten program and the duration of this effect on the reading scores of LEP students over 4 academic years. Vygotsky's theory of constructivism provided the framework for this study. The difference between the reading scores of LEP students at the end of 4 consecutive academic years for LEP students who attended a full-day and a half-day kindergarten were compared. The sample included N = 78 LEP kindergarten students. Results from independent t tests and Kruskal-Wallis tests confirmed no significant difference between the means of the 2 groups across all 4 academic years. No short- or long-term effect has been found of the full-day kindergarten program. Recommendations for the district are to look for strategies other than the full-day program to increase the reading achievement of LEP students. Implications for positive social change include providing educators and researchers with information that can result in increased reading achievement for LEP students.

          "dc:description": "Most mathematics assignments consist of a group of problems requiring the same strategy. For example, a lesson on the quadratic formula is typically followed by a block of problems requiring students to use the quadratic formula, which means that students know the appropriate strategy before they read each problem. In an alternative approach, different kinds of problems appear in an interleaved order, which requires students to choose the strategy on the basis of the problem itself. In the classroom-based experiment reported here, grade seven students (n = 140) received blocked or interleaved practice over a nine-week period, followed two weeks later by an unannounced test. Mean test scores were greater for material learned by interleaved practice rather than by blocked practice (72% vs. 38%, d = 1.05). This interleaving effect was observed even though the different kinds of problems were superficially dissimilar from each other, whereas previous interleaved mathematics studies required students to learn nearly identical kinds of problems. We conclude that interleaving improves mathematics learning not only by improving discrimination between different kinds of problems but also by strengthening the association between each kind of problem and its corresponding strategy.

          "dc:description": "Researchers of leadership in management have explored why some managers excel in their positions and others fail. Some researchers have suggested that managers who use emotional intelligence while leading have a better opportunity to promote organizational success. Ineffective leadership may contribute to employees\u0026apos; poor performance and lack of commitment to the organization\u0026apos;s mission. This study used a quantitative survey design to evaluate the correlation between situational leadership styles and emotional intelligence in retail managers. Data were collected from 130 participants\u0026apos; responses to two instruments: the Leadership Behavior Analysis II-Self and the Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test. The results indicated that more than half of the respondents were above normal on their flexibility scores and below normal on their effectiveness scores, which indicates that more leadership training is needed. Flexibility of leadership styles was negatively correlated with emotional intelligence and educational level was positively correlated to emotional intelligence. Exploring the relationship between situational leadership and emotional intelligence is a new endeavor in social sciences research. Implications for positive social change include leaders of retail organizations being able to understand how situational leadership styles and emotional intelligence work together to build leadership effectiveness. Managers will learn how to produce long-term results while improving their emotional intelligence skills. Furthermore, employee effectiveness can be increased through motivation and education, making a positive impact on retail organizations\u0026apos; financial stability.

          "dc:description": "Public school education and reform face a myriad of challenges that are uniquely different from those of years past. Tougher curriculum standards, societal differences, cultural diversity and an overall shift in educational attitudes and practices may limit and change the educational success of many children. The cognitive development of students and knowledge base of students entering school is coherently critical to the success of not only the child, but the school and school system as well. Because of this, high stakes are now placed upon a school's performance. With the unyielding pressure to excel on standardized tests, schools often find it critical for students to enter kindergarten ready to learn and having skills previously unheard of. This study took an in-depth look at the skills students should have prior to entering kindergarten as well as the informal education they receive from their home environment prior to entering formal education in a suburban north Georgia school district. The study collected and interpreted data, test scores, and parent surveys in order to decipher a correlation. Based on the results of the responses as indicated on the parent survey, there were not any specific home or preschool activities that significantly affected GKIDS scores. On the contrary, the age of the kindergarten student does significantly affect students' GKIDS scores. This study paved the way to creating and developing programs, literature, classes, and insight that will help future kindergarteners and their parents ensure kindergarten success.

This gap compounds economic and social inequities in the region. A solution to the problem is important to educators and policy makers in providing an equitable education for all students. Using the conceptual framework of organizational culture, this qualitative project study explored the district\u0026apos;s policies and practices on the academic program for English learners and whether policies result in meeting academic needs of English-learning students at the secondary level. One-on-one interviews with district personnel, observations in classrooms, and documents were analyzed using interpretive policy analysis. Three goals drove the data collection: (a) identify inconsistent or conflicting district policies; (b) identify the impact of district policies on diverse groups; and (c) determine a foundation for district administration to write policy. While no inconsistent or conflicting policies were identified, the evidence suggested the need for clear, frequent communication between the different policy actors and professional development for administrators and teachers in schools to create successful academic systems for English learners.

          "dc:description": "Speech prosody is a multi-faceted dimension of speech which can be measured and analyzed in a variety of ways. In this study, the speech prosody of Mandarin L1 speakers, English L2 speakers, and English L1 speakers was assessed by trained raters who listened to sound clips of the speakers responding to a graph prompt and reading a short passage. In order to eliminate other factors that might distract from assessing only the prosodic \u0026quot;goodness\u0026quot; of a given speaker, the sound clips were acoustically filtered to attenuate all frequencies 500 Hz and above. This cut-off was used with the aim of preserving prosodic characteristics without including interference from segmental features where possible. The raters who participated in this study were trained to use the OEPT (Oral English Proficiency Test) scale to rate holistic speech in an unfiltered condition so this study employs an adapted version of that scale. The levels of the adapted scale were as follows: (1) L1 Mandarin Prosody, (3) L2 Novice English Prosody, (5) L2 Intermediate English Prosody, (7) Advanced English Prosody, (9) L1 English Prosody. For each sound clip, the raters were asked to assign one of these proficiency levels and describe in qualitative terms why they choose that score. EFL students from different universities in China were also asked to complete this task of rating filtered speech along the same scale. The resulting analysis will examine the usefulness of rating prosody through filtered speech for L2 prosody assessment as well as its potential benefits for prosody pedagogical development.

The purpose of the \u0026quot;No Child Left Behind Act\u0026quot; (NCLB) and the \u0026quot;Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\u0026quot; (IDEA) was to bridge the achievement gap among students and to ensure they developed proficiency in focus subjects. One of the NCLB goals was to staff each classroom with a special education teacher. According to the study findings, special education teachers believed that NCLB did result in significant improvement of instructional methods. Study results indicated that the implementation of IDEA did lead to significant improvement of instructional methods. Study findings showed that educators perceived the NCLB strategies did lead to a decrease in the achievement gap between the two groups of high school students. This study used a quantitative descriptive research methodology to evaluate the perceived level of effectiveness of NCLB and IDEA strategies in the special education program. Use of a quantitative research methodology enabled the researcher to determine, measure, and analyze data to test the hypotheses developed from the three research questions. The population of interest consisted of special education teachers, specifically the highly qualified special education teachers. The research instrument for the study was a survey questionnaire distributed to 130 special education teachers. The selected sample included highly qualified and effective high school special education teachers from five urban inner-city schools in an urban Midwestern U.S. school district. This sample was selected because these teachers were the ones executing and evaluating the effectiveness of NCLB and IDEA and they could describe the tangible implications of the changes. The findings of this research are important because they provide noteworthy insight into NCLB and IDEA strategies for improving the academic achievement of students with disabilities. This study establishes that more efficient instructional practices and educational leadership are significant requisites for improving the quality of education for students with disabilities.

It helps to clarify the questions that each model answers best, as well as the limitations of each model. This document is intended to support states as they address the challenges of evolving assessment and accountability systems. This guide does not promote one type of interpretation over another. Rather, it describes growth models in terms of the interpretations they best support and, in turn, the questions they are best designed to answer. The goal of this guide is thus to increase alignment between user interpretations and model function in order for models to best serve their desired purposes: increasing student achievement, decreasing achievement gaps, and improving the effectiveness of educators and schools. The report is divided into two parts. Part I, A Framework for Operational Growth Models, includes seven models: (1) Growth and Growth Models; (2) Growth: Beyond Status; (3) Different Ways to Slice the Data: Status, Improvement, and Growth; (4) What is a Growth Model?; (5) Growth Models of Interest; (6) Critical Questions for Describing Growth Models; and (7) Alternative Growth Model Classification Schemes. Part II, The Growth Models, includes seven chapters: 1: The Gain Score Model; (2) The Trajectory Model; (3) The Categorical Model; (4) The Residual Gain Model; (5) The Projection Model; (6) The Student Growth Percentile Model; and (7) The Multivariate Model. An appendix explains cross-referencing growth model terms. A bibliography is also included.",

The specific research questions that guided this study include: 1. How does the literacy intervention, Fast ForWord, affect EOG growth scores at the seventh grade level? 2. What factors, including Fast ForWord, best predict a struggling student's scores on the North Carolina End of Grade test? The subjects for data collection were a total of two hundred and ninety-one seventh grade students at a middle school in Anson County, North Carolina. The students were enrolled in seventh grade in the 2010-2011 academic year and in the eighth grade. When correlating the strength of the relationship between the dependent variable, EOG scores, and the independent variable, the number of Fast ForWord products completed, a single linear regression was performed. Based on the regression statistics, R Squared was equal to 0.004. The ANOVA calculations showed a Significance Factor of 0.29. To analyze the impact of multiple variables on an outcome, a multiple regression analysis was used to calculate what factors, including Fast ForWord, best predict a struggling student's scores on the North Carolina End of Grade test.

          "dc:description": "This study sought to find evidence for a beneficial learning theory to teach computer software programs. Additionally, software was analyzed for each learning theory\u0026apos;s applicability to resolve whether certain software requires a specific method of education. The results are meant to give educators more effective teaching tools, so students ultimately get the most out of any particular software program. The study\u0026apos;s value comes from additional significant information added to the established constructivist and instructivist debate, which is important to psychologists and educators. The design of the study was a randomized quantitative experiment with an analysis of covariance design employing four groups, gathered using convenience sampling, in a pretest, posttest model to analyze multiple independent variables. Further design parameters included a 2 X 2 Factorial Design, 0.05 significance, large post hoc Cohen f effect size for learning theory, and 89% power. The sample was 167 students enrolled in Digital Image Manipulation, Digital Layout, Digital Illustration, or Digital Typography classes during two quarters of 2012. The participants were analyzed in their normal classroom environment using an online test/lesson/test exercise. The instrument was Photoshop CS5 and InDesign CS5 uCertify Adobe Certified Expert (ACE) exam preparation guides. Research Question 1 stated: Is constructivist or behavioral learning theory more beneficial when teaching multimedia software? A significant finding for Research Question 1 indicates a difference between the learning theories behaviorism and constructivism. The behaviorist group scored higher than the constructivist group. Research Question 2 stated: Is there a difference in the effectiveness of learning between Photoshop and InDesign when teaching multimedia software? There was no significant finding for Research Question 2; therefore, no difference was found between Photoshop and InDesign. Research Question 3 stated: Are there interactions between learning theory and software with regards to teaching multimedia software? No interaction was found between learning theory and software. According to the current study, teachers who instruct their courses through a problem-based constructivist method should consider a behaviorist approach. A behavioral learning curriculum is especially important if the class is instructing Adobe software. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

Recent research indicates that perceptual learning (PL) interventions facilitate discovery of structure and recognition of patterns in mathematical domains, as assessed by tests of mathematical competence. Here we sought direct evidence that a brief perceptual learning module (PLM) produces changes in basic information extraction. Accuracy and speed of undergraduate participants' encoding of equations was assessed in a psychophysical task at pretest and delayed posttest. In between, the experimental group completed an \u0026quot;Algebraic Transformations PLM,\u0026quot; which involved identifying valid transformations of equations. Relative to controls, PLM participants showed reliable changes in encoding equations, detectable psychophysically 24 hours later. Encoding improvements were shown robustly by participants who were initially less proficient at algebra and were negligible for participants who were initially proficient. These results provide direct evidence for durable changes in information encoding produced by a PL intervention targeting a complex mathematical skill.",

But while these investments have transformed reading instruction and reading outcomes for many learners, too many children are not reading at the basic level nor are they reading with understanding. The Institute of Education Sciences created the Reading for Understanding Research Initiative in 2010 to fund a set of connected projects that would enrich the theoretical frameworks that undergird efforts to improve deep comprehension and to design and test new interventions and assessments to improve reading for understanding across all grades in U.S. schools. This article describes the central themes that guided the design of the Reading for Understanding Initiative and the work underway by the six research teams funded under this program.

In this summative report, program effectiveness has been examined in three aspects, \u0026quot;Noyce Scholar recruitment,\u0026quot; \u0026quot;institutional support for teacher preparation,\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;the concurrent impact on high-needs schools.\u0026quot; The evaluation design conforms to a well-established model of Results-Based Accountability to address nine questions: (1) How much has been done in student recruitment? (2) How well did the program perform in student recruitment? (3) Did high-needs schools benefit from the Noyce Scholar recruitment? (4) How much has been done to meet STEM teacher requirements? (5) How well did the program do to enrich STEM learning opportunities? (6) Did the program benefit teacher preparation in high-needs schools? (7) How much has been accomplished in program support? (8) How well did the program do in grant administration? (9) Did the program benefit student learning in high-needs schools? Professional standards in teacher education have been incorporated to facilitate the triangulation of quantitative and qualitative data from Noyce Scholar surveys, interviews, and transcript analyses. Three recommendations are adduced to support teacher preparation during the no cost extension.",

Data for this report were collected through an online questionnaire administered by districts in the SWTREC in April 2013 and completed by one person from each participating school. Seventeen of the twenty-one high schools within the SWTREC districts responded to the survey. More than 80 percent of responding schools reported offering online or distance-learning courses in school year 2012/13. On average, schools provided more online than distance-learning courses, and they had higher enrollments in online courses. Both online and distance-learning courses were used to provide students with access to dual enrollment courses. Schools that offered online courses most often identified the opportunity for students to accelerate credit accumulation as a \u0026quot;very important\u0026quot; reason for offering the courses. Technological limitations--both the availability of technology and restricted periods when technology was available--were barriers schools perceived in offering online and distance-learning courses. A survey instrument is appended.",

          "dc:description": "For some time, it has been clear that students who are tutored generally learn more than students who experience classroom instruction (e.g., Bloom, 1984). Much research has been devoted to identifying features of tutorial dialogue that can explain its effectiveness, so that these features can be simulated in natural-language tutoring systems. One hypothesis is that the highly interactive nature of tutoring itself promotes learning--that is, the \u0026quot;interaction hypothesis.\u0026quot; Although reasonable and agreeing with much research, the interaction hypothesis raises the question of what linguistic mechanisms are involved: that is, which features of \u0026quot;highly interactive\u0026quot; dialogues trigger what processes that are conducive to learning? Our overall strategy in the research described in this article was to inform this question by identifying co-constructed discourse relations in tutorial dialogues whose frequency of occurrence predicts learning, identify the context in which these relations occur, and use this knowledge to formulate decision rules to guide automated dialogues. We used Rhetorical Structure Theory to identify and tag co-constructed discourse relations in a large corpus of physics tutoring dialogues. Our analyses suggest that the effectiveness of human tutoring might well lie in the language of tutoring itself. Moreover, the types of co-constructed discourse relations that predict learning seem to vary based on students' ability level. We describe Rimac, a natural-language tutoring system that implements an initial set of decision rules based on these analyses. These rules guide reflective dialogues about the concepts associated with physics problems. Rimac is being pilot tested in high school physics classes.",

Based on this review of literature, five key factors were determined to potentially contribute to a successful information security culture. A survey instrument was designed to determine if each of the key factors had a significant association with a successful organizational information security culture, if the factors had a positive or negative relationship with a successful information security culture, and the strength of the relationship to a successful organizational security culture. The data from 200 useable surveys were analyzed using the Chi Square Test of Independence and Bivariate/Pearson\u0026apos;s correlation to determine the relation between each of the key factors, the independent variables, and the dependent variable, defined as a successful organizational information security culture. The analysis of this data is presented for both scholarly and practitioner information and use. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

A multiple probe single subject design was employed to measure the effect of the intervention across three different texts including leveled SRA readers, stories from a local newspaper, and sections from employee handbooks. Results indicate that the PPD intervention was successful in increasing comprehension as measured by the students\u0026apos; story retell abilities. Comprehension assessment was collected in both three option knowledge based multiple-choice questions and student retell of the text content. While mixed results were observed in the multiple-choice accuracy, this study revealed that the PPD intervention was effective in increasing student comprehension by improving the story retell in terms of quantity (i.e. word count and idea units) and quality (i.e. text and picture relevant idea units) across the text types. These overall positive effects were replicated in the generalization phase, which involved peer supports in an inclusive, neutral school setting.

          "dc:description": "Relationship marketing is attracting, maintaining, and, in multi-service organizations, enhancing customer relationships. Educational programs and services, like those of businesses, depend highly on the repeated purchases of their loyal customers. The purpose of this descriptive research is to investigate the relationships between factors that may lead to student loyalty in online graduate educational programs. Specifically, the study seeks to examine the relationships between service quality, technology, trust, commitment and satisfaction, reputation and ultimately loyalty. A new model is presented, which includes the results of testing these variables. The results of this study concluded that satisfaction with the program has the highest degree of association with student loyalty. Although service quality was found to be one of the key correlates to student loyalty to the program in face-to-face educational settings, it was found to be an insignificant element in assessing student loyalty to the program in online courses. Surprisingly, the construct of technology was found to be an important factor; specially, the role of using synchronous online tools. The findings also support relationship marketing theory (Morgan \u0026amp; Hunt, 1994) and the roles of commitment and trust. However, this research found the role of commitment more important than that of trust. This study recognized reputation of the university as a vital mediator for building a mutually beneficial relationship between students and universities. The research includes implications to help service providers (educational institutions) improve their marketing strategies to ensure that online students (customers) remain with their desired online programs.

The SGS curriculum was designed to teach students a set of simple behaviors to prompt and reinforce supportive teacher behavior. Student use of the SGS behaviors was hypothesized to initiate a constructive cycle of student-teacher interactions that increase teacher display of supportive behaviors and student display of SGS behaviors and academic engagement. Results of the study provided evidence of a functional relation between participation in the SGS curriculum and increased student use of requests for teacher feedback. They also provided evidence of a functional relation between student requests for feedback and teacher provision of feedback. While this study did not provide evidence of the establishment of constructive cycles of support it did offer the following: a) high school teachers typically engaged in low levels of the identified support behaviors, and b) students were able to reliably elicit these supportive behaviors by engaging in relatively simple prompting behaviors. Potential implications of the results and future research are discussed. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

The Wisconsin Knowledge and Concepts Examination (WKCE) measured academic achievement for tenth graders including reading, language arts, mathematics, science and social studies. The ten independent variables included geographic location, socioeconomic status, students of color, spending per pupil in the school district, high school enrollment, parent education level, truancy, disciplinary actions: suspensions and expulsions, students with disabilities and extra/co-curricular activity participation. Data were provided by state and federal public databases. Findings indicated that rural high schools in the state of Wisconsin performed as well as town and city high schools and in some subject areas as well as suburban high schools. Further, the data suggest that there are serious academic performance concerns for students and schools with certain demographics and that those problems need to be addressed immediately and effectively. Findings from this study suggest that the argument to consolidate rural high schools because of poor academic performance is not a valid one. All high schools in Wisconsin including rural high schools should be supported by policy makers and practitioners to ensure high academic achievement opportunities for all.

Many institutions are taking action to increase retention rates by exploring their academic programs. Regression analysis was used to compare the effectiveness of ACT mathematics scores, high school grade point averages (HSGPA), and demographic factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic status for predicting final grades in students' first mathematics courses at Spring Hill College. The results of this study were examined to validate whether the current system for placing students in first-year mathematics courses is successful. Data was used from 870 student records for the freshman fall cohorts from 2008 to 2010. Students were enrolled in Intermediate Algebra, Precalculus, or Calculus I. The results of the study indicate that ACT mathematics score, HSGPA, age, and gender were all statistically significant predictors of students' grades in their first-year mathematics courses with HSGPA the best predictor of all. It was recommended that admission counselors and mathematics department faculty place students in freshmen mathematics courses based on HSGPA, ACT mathematics scores, and the number of mathematics courses taken in high school but with a much stronger emphasis on HSGPA.

ASCA national standards encourage PSCs to demonstrate accountability for student outcomes. The American School Counselor Association (ASCA) emphasizes the role of the school counselor in assisting students with academic performance and social and emotional well-being. Based on attachment, engagement, and empowerment theories, this study seeks to understand the relationship between PSC led treatment and student (a) social bonds and support systems (engagement), (b) social skills development (attachment), (c) academic monitoring skills (engagement), and (d) personal self-awareness and self-regulation skills (empowerment) with at-risk high school students as defined by truancy. To this end, attachment, engagement, and empowerment have been measured before and after the implementation of PSC led school-based interventions.

Although professors widely lament students' propensity to ignore the carefully chosen textbooks, research specifically investigating why this phenomenon occurs is minimal. Bookstores have reported that fewer students are buying textbooks, perhaps due to rising costs (Mehegan, 2004). A volunteer sample of 19 undergraduate students at a regional university in the midsouth participated in a semi-structured focus group interview regarding their use of college textbooks. Questions were asked concerning textbook cost, course requirements related to the text, student knowledge of textbook features, performance in the course related to textbook use, and the pros and cons of e-textbooks. Researchers took notes on a laptop and also audio-taped the interview. Student responses were analyzed using the constant-comparative method. Results indicated that students were buying textbooks, although they felt that any further rise in cost might prohibit them from purchasing texts for all courses. Generally, students reported that they were not reading the textbooks, as such. They used them more as a reference in case they needed further explanation of a concept they didn't fully understand from the professor's lecture, notes of the lecture, or the additional material (PowerPoint slides, diagrams, etc.) made available online by the professor. Students liked having physical texts, but some were open to the idea of e-textbooks. They noted that being asked questions over information that was covered only in the textbook would get them to at least skim the assigned chapters. Frustration was expressed with teachers who assigned a text but never required anything that would force use of the textbook by students. Interview questions for textbook focus groups are appended.",

          "dc:description": "This mixed methods explanatory study addressed the problem of continuing disparity in achievement between students with special needs and their peers in the educational setting, despite mandates requiring schools to educate these students in the least restrictive environment. The purpose of this study was to determine the types and extent of resources used by general education teachers regarding their special needs students. Constructivism provided the theoretical foundation for the study. The research questions were designed to determine teachers\u0026apos; perceptions of the types and effectiveness of collaboration between general and special education teachers. A nonrandom sample of 49 intermediate general education teachers in a northwestern school district responded to a researcher-developed survey. Data were grouped and analyzed using ANOVA, correlation and chi-square statistical tests to answer each of 5 research questions. Internal consistency reliability analyses were conducted using the survey data. Open-ended responses were thematically coded and results were used to explain findings. Findings showed that direct consultation with a special education teacher was the preferred type of resource, however less than 1 hour per week was actually spent consulting. Teacher collaboration with peers was perceived as effective for improving self-esteem, social skills and interpersonal relationships for students. Recommendations for the district include administrative support for professional development to improve the collaborative process. The findings could affect positive social change when teachers are engaged in improving the learning environment and achievement of students with special needs to facilitate employment opportunities for this group of students.

          "dc:description": "This dissertation contains three studies that investigate whether attested patterns of constituent order distribution and change in the world\u0026apos;s languages can be attributed, in part, to cognitive preferences for some constituent orders over others. To assess these preferences, seven experiments employed an \u0026quot;elicited pantomime\u0026quot; task. Communication in gesture without speech may reveal cognitive pressures that otherwise remain hidden. Study 1 manipulates the whether the to-be-described events are semantically non-reversible (e.g. a woman lifting a box) or reversible (e.g. a woman lifting a boy). Across three experiments, participants reliably preferred SOV for describing non-reversible events in pantomime, but avoided using SOV to describe reversible events. Although previous accounts have assumed similar behavior to be due to constraints on comprehension, the distribution of alternative orders (mainly SVO, OSV, \u0026amp; SOSV) suggests a greater role for constraints on production in explaining these patterns. Whereas Study 1 focuses on explaining drifts away from SOV, Study 2 tests the hypothesis that languages drift toward SVO because natural languages are subject to additional constraints that pantomime may not engage, such as pressures on information structure and efficiency. These additional pressures might work against OSV and SOSV, leaving SVO as a preferred solution for reversible events. Experiment 1 (English speakers) created more language-like conditions by simulating the emergence of a lexicon and of shared lexical knowledge. Under these conditions, OSV and SOSV decreased, and SVO increased. Experiment 2 found similar patterns with native speakers of an SOV language (Turkish), suggesting that the increase in SVO among English speakers was not simply a result of influence from their native language. Whereas Studies 1 and 2 focus on constituent order preferences in pantomime production, Study 3 focuses on pantomime comprehension. Speculation about constituent order preferences in comprehension has figured largely in linguistic and psycholinguistic theory, but little empirical evidence is currently available. Using a novel paradigm, Study 3 finds that constituent order preferences in comprehension are distinctly different from those in production, for both speakers of English (Experiment 1) and Turkish (Experiment 2). Results suggest that constraints on production may play a greater role than previously thought. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

          "dc:description": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not decreased articulation of speech played a role in the ability of an individual with Down syndrome or Fragile X syndrome to signal noncomprehension and whether the two groups differed in their levels of articulation of speech and noncomprehension signaling ability. The research was conducted using a group comparison design with two independent groups. The independent variable was the diagnosis of either Down syndrome or Fragile X syndrome, and the dependent variables were articulation of speech and noncomprehension signaling ability. The study was conducted in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, with 36 male participants, 18 each with Down syndrome and Fragile X syndrome. A screening assessment confirmed that the participants could hear within normal limits and that they were able to sit and attend, and follow simple directives. Performance on a receptive and expressive language assessment indicated that the groups did not differ significantly in their vocabulary and language abilities. The dependent variables of primary interest included number of errors on an articulation test, given to determine quality of speech for each participant, and number of noncomprehension signals on a noncomprehension signaling task, which was administered to determine if the participants could ask for clarification when unclear directions were presented to them. Results indicated that there was a significant relationship between articulation of speech, as measured by articulation errors, and noncomprehension signaling for both groups combined and for the DS group, but not for the FXS group. Results also indicated that, although articulation of speech was not significantly different in males with DS and FXS, males with DS were more likely to noncomprehension signal than males with FXS.

          "dc:description": "This study focuses on the issue of learning equity in colleges and universities where teaching and learning have come to depend heavily on computer technologies. The study uses the Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) latent variable model to quantitatively investigate whether there is a gender /ethnicity difference in using computer based course management system (CMS) for course tasks. The study further investigates whether there is an association between course management system use and academic achievement. The MIMIC model has many advantages for the current data analysis, including an allowance for simultaneous examination of multiple group differences in a latent factor framework. In this study, data from over 993 students who enrolled in the three courses, Anthropology 201, Biology 206, and Chemistry 116, at a Midwest public university were collected in the spring of 2010. These three courses were selected because the instructors and students actively utilized a course management system for their teaching and learning activities. Data preparation involved the removal of extraneous records and transformation of the original data in order to satisfy the assumption of MIMIC model. The model building procedure began by checking the validity of the measurement model without covariates, followed by incorporating covariate variables--gender (males versus females) and ethnicity (African Americans, Asian Americans, Caucasians, Hispanic Americans)--into the fitted measurement model. A final model with the best model fit was selected for testing group invariance. Results from the final model revealed that: (a) group invariance was present for gender and ethnic groups in use of the course management system. Male students had a significantly higher mean on their frequency of using the course management system than female students. Asian students had the significantly highest mean among all the ethnic groups. Additionally, (b) the amount of involvement in the course management system had positive association with student's academic outcome. When student's scholastic aptitude was controlled, Asian students who used the course management system the most frequently tended to have the highest academic outcome. These findings may imply that \u0026quot;digital divide\u0026quot; experienced in childhood might continue to impact course management system use in college to some extent; also, the quantity use of course management system was critical to student academic outcome, but quantity alone could not guarantee a dramatic improvement of academic achievement. The quality of course management system use needs to be defined. The study has significant implications for policy and practice. Specifically, the study discusses in detail practical methods for eliminating academic discrepancies, which may be due to different uses of course management system. Finally, the study points to new directions for research into course management system use in higher education.

          "dc:description": "This study traces the first year experiences of six international exchange teachers employed in three public and charter schools settings from three districts in two southeastern states. Interviews with these teachers from China, Germany and Colombia, and with their school and district leaders enabled me to produce a narrative of how international exchange teachers adapt to teaching in American schools. I adopted a cooperative stance as I observed and audio recorded their personal and professional lives at the beginning of the school year, then again shortly following the scheduled mid-year winter break, and for a third time before end-of-year state testing in the spring. I found that all of these international exchange teachers shared two struggles. First, there were challenges of adjusting to the lifestyle: to acknowledge that America is as diverse as it is homogeneous. Second, was the challenge of adjusting to the mores of American life---that of getting a state license to drive, buying a car, finding an insurance agent to provide vehicle coverage. Also find a place to live, access to water and electrical services, and secure household furnishings became an unexpected endeavor. The context of colleagueship was shown to fall within a short window of time. This was due to teachers arriving in the states after the school year had begun with little time to prepare rooms or gather classroom materials. When comparing the practices of the participants in their native countries to their American classroom practices mirror the current culture. Participants had unclear expectations of the program design, and procedural expectations. Central to that focus was management of student's behavior, lack of classroom resources and understanding parent participation and parent expectations. Common themes emerged, indicating these teachers all had a desire to work with students, a passion for teaching and expanded opportunities in their home countries that stem from their experiences teaching in the United States. Exemplary models of induction both in the U. S. and internationally should be sought in order to identify and disseminate best practices that would better accommodate international exchange teachers' transition into the teaching carousel.

          "dc:description": "The current study evaluated the efficacy of a training series designed to teach typical school-based behavior support professionals to build behavioral interventions from functional behavioral assessment (FBA) information. The study was conducted in three stages. First, a descriptive assessment examined the extent to which typical school team leaders demonstrated knowledge of core behavior support plan (BSP) development features following a four-part training series on the development and implementation of function based supports. The second stage of the study assessed the extent to which participants who met criteria for BSP development during training were then able to lead a typical school team in building a BSP that was perceived by expert behavior analysts as \u0026quot;technically sound.\u0026quot; In the final stage, a nonconcurrent multiple-baseline design was used to determine if there is a functional relationship between implementation of BSPs led by typical school-team leaders who received the training and improvement in the level of student problem behavior. Thirteen school professionals participated in four 1-hour \u0026quot;From Basic FBA to BSP\u0026quot; training sessions. A post test analysis of BSP knowledge indicated that the participants ended training with the knowledge needed to use FBA information to develop student BSPs. Six of the 13 professionals went on to lead school-based teams in the development of BSPs that were rated by outside experts as technically adequate. Direct observation data were collected on student behavior during the implementation of five of the six resulting BSPs, and decreases in problem behavior and increases in academic engagement were seen for all five student participants. Additionally, participating team leaders and classroom staff indicated that they found the procedures and tools used to be both acceptable and effective. These results document preliminary findings supporting the efficacy of a four-part training series used to teach typical school staff to use FBA data in designing student BSPs. Further implications for practice in schools and directions for future research are discussed. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

          "dc:description": "Faced with expectations to improve student learning and increasing student alternatives, school districts are challenged to make system-wide and sustainable improvement in student learning outcomes. The national accountability movement is associated with a growing body of research that has considered the role of the district to influence student outcomes throughout the system. This study sought to identify differences in the presence and impact of three research-based district-reform factors: the district instructional vision, the commitment and capacity to enact the vision, and the use of a multi-level data system as a means of providing feedback on progress towards the vision. Additionally, the study sought to identify differences in perceived impact on site leadership capacity and teacher self-efficacy and job satisfaction. An exploratory comparative case study methodology was employed using an online survey and semi-structured interviews to collect and analyze data on eighteen variables. Two California unified school districts were compared based on differences in district-wide student improvement rates on annual testing. An exploratory factor analysis identified a set of empirically-based factors consisting of district-based initiative and actions, site-based instructional decision making and, site leadership associated with the survey providing an alternate perspective to organize data while offering an additional lens to consider the impact of the research-based factors. Total population and two within-group samples were compared between districts. Findings surfaced differences in perceptions and actions of district-wide staff associated with district vision, commitment and capacity building, data use, and site leadership variables. No differences were found in the presence of teacher self-efficacy and job satisfaction between the two districts. While limited in their generalizability, the results appear to point out the influence of a district instructional vision on district commitment, professional development, and site leadership. Topics for further research include the impact of district instructional vision on high school reform efforts, on large urban school districts, and influences of the school district community in establishing and maintaining an instructional vision. The study concludes by offering implications for practice associated with district-wide student outcome improvements.

          "dc:description": "Many students enter institutions of higher education underprepared for college level coursework. Instructors must establish early connections with these students to engage them in their required coursework and foster success in remedial coursework. The purpose of this descriptive, quantitative study was to examine the sensory processing preferences of community college developmental math instructors and students enrolled in remedial math as a means to gain insights into the potential role of sensory preferences in student engagement, academic achievement, and plan for persistence. The framework of this study was a combination of theory related to sensory processing and current research in the area of student engagement and persistence in order to determine if similarities between sensory profiles of instructors and those of students positively impact student engagement, academic achievement, and plan for persistence. Instructors and students were grouped based on similar (SSP) and dissimilar (DSP) Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profiles. Degree of student engagement and plan for persistence identified by the CLASSE-Student survey and final course grades were compared between the two groups using independent t tests for each dependent variable. Data analysis revealed that plan for persistence between the two groups was statistically significant; suggesting that degree of similarity of the instructor and student sensory profiles may impact a student\u0026apos;s plan to enroll in a course the next semester. Implications for social change include using findings in training for remedial math instructors to provide them greater insight into the role of sensory preferences as a predictor for plan for persistence of students requiring remedial math education.

          "dc:description": "In order for simulations and games to be effective for learning, instructional designers must verify that the underlying computational models being used have an appropriate degree of fidelity to the conceptual models of their real-world counterparts. A simulation/game that provides incorrect feedback is likely to promote misunderstanding and adversely affect learning and transfer. Numerous methods for verifying the accuracy of a computational model exist, but it is generally accepted that no single method is adequate and that multiple methods should be used. The purpose of this study was to propose and test a new method for collecting and analyzing users\u0026apos; interaction data (e.g., choices made, actions taken, results and feedback obtained) to provide quantified evidence that the underlying computational model of a simulation/game represents the conceptual model with sufficient accuracy. In this study, analysis of patterns in time (APT) was used to compare gameplay results from the Diffusion Simulation Game (DSG) with predictions based on diffusion of innovations theory (DOI). A program was written to automatically play the DSG by analyzing the game state during each turn, seeking patterns of game component attributes that matched optimal strategies based on DOI theory. When the use of optimal strategies did not result in the desired number of successful games, here defined as the threshold of confidence for model verification, further investigation revealed flaws in the computational model. These flaws were incrementally corrected and subsequent gameplay results were analyzed until the threshold of confidence was achieved. In addition to analysis of patterns in time for model verification (APTMV), other verification methods used included code walkthrough, execution tracing, desk checking, syntax checking, and statistical analysis. The APTMV method was found to be complementary to these other methods, providing quantified evidence of the computational model\u0026apos;s degree of accuracy and pinpointing flaws that could be corrected to improve fidelity. The APTMV approach to verification and improvement of computational models is described and compared with other methods, and improvements to the process are proposed.

          "dc:description": "The nation is showing an unprecedented focus on increasing the rigor in education and preparing students for college. The college readiness trend is driving changes in the ways in which the nation uses student test data. Educational data are no longer limited to static data snapshots showing the status of a student performance at one point in time. Instead data are linked grade-to-grade and course-to-course, to create a longitudinal measure of student performance. Inferences about student progress are now made using status as well as growth models. The new national trend is to enhance the ability to draw inferences about student growth by collecting more direct evidence from longitudinal student data. The use of longitudinal data expands beyond informing about student progress to evaluating teachers and educational leaders. President Obama has repeatedly highlighted the need for teacher effectiveness measures and offered incentives for those who are willing to implement them. The Department of Education awarded billions of dollars from the Race to the Top fund to 11 states and the District of Columbia in 2010. In granting the awards, the Department evaluated state applications for which 28% of the points were dedicated to a section entitled \u0026quot;Great Teachers and Leaders.\u0026quot; As part of the application requirements, states had to develop and describe a system for assessing teacher effectiveness that included student achievement data and provided annual effectiveness ratings for all teachers. States awarded the Race to the Top funds are currently working to implement their plans for teacher effectiveness systems, with most relying on student growth measures as essential measures in their systems. The use of student score changes in different applications has led to confusion in the use of terms and concepts. Terms such as student growth, value-added models, and teacher effectiveness are often used interchangeably. The differences in these three measures are significant. Using one when another is intended has impeded the nation's ability to develop these measures well and to use the information in optimal ways. The goal of this paper is to define student growth, value-added models, and teacher effectiveness, the three terms that are often confused. Furthermore, the paper compares and contrasts features of these three measures and identifies next steps needed for advancing the use of these measures for educational reform.",

          "dc:description": "Universities worldwide are transitioning to blended learning where technology is used to enhance and augment traditional face-to-face instruction. Investigation of how well blended learning strategies are accepted and adopted in multicultural settings is needed to facilitate this transition. This study investigated factors and barriers that influence faculty attitudes toward the adoption of technology-rich blended learning at Jazan University in Saudi Arabia. The influence of faculty incentives, faculty's technology experience and demographic variables including gender, academic rank were important considerations. In his Diffusion of Innovations model, Everett Rogers identifies five stages in the adoption process: knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation. The amount of time that transpires before adoption is influenced by several factors including readiness of the adoptees, perceived barriers and incentives. Knowledge of technologies may influence readiness for adoption of blended learning. This study employed a mixed method approach using quantitative and qualitative data. Participants were 303 faculty members (234 male, 69 female) from 36 departments. Descriptive statistics, independent t-test, simple and multiple regression analysis, and correlation coefficients were employed. Faculty reported positive attitudes toward blended learning (M = 3.94) on a five point Likert scale. Female faculty (M = 2.88) reported more barriers to implementing blended learning than male faculty (M = 2.49), (t 301 = -4.43, p \u0026lt; 0.05). Female faculty also reported less experience in using educational technologies (M = 3.54), than male faculty (M = 3.95), (t 301 = 3.76, p \u0026lt; 0.05). Faculty experience with educational technologies was a significant predictor of attitudes toward adopting blended learning, F (1,301) = 32.55, p \u0026lt; 0.05. Faculty attitudes toward adoption of blended learning were negatively correlated with perceived barriers (r = -0.30, p \u0026lt; 0.05). There was a positive correlation between attitudes and perceived incentives for adopting blended learning (r = 0.72, p \u0026lt; 0.05). This Saudi university is making progress toward adopting blended learning. Female faculty members appear to be at the beginning of the Rogers implementation stage while male faculty may be approaching confirmation. Male faculty may be further along in adopting blended learning because they perceive fewer barriers and they have more advanced technical skills. Adequate technical support is important for implementing blended learning. Also, professional development programs are needed to support faculty competencies on current and emerging technologies. This support should benefit the faculty's willingness and ability to support blended learning. Future research might consider the impact of various professional development support strategies and infrastructure support on the adoption of blended learning in diverse cultural settings.

          "dc:description": "Investigating students' perceptions of their classroom environment is one of the ways researchers and educators can effectively determine what factors may benefit students' learning. Student Perceptions of Classroom Quality (SPOCQ; Gentry \u0026amp; Owen, 2004) was used with a group of Chinese gifted and general secondary students in the study. SPOCQ measures students' perceived appeal, challenge, choice, meaningfulness, and academic self-efficacy in their classes, five factors closely related to students' motivation and learning. The purpose of this study was threefold: to investigate if the Chinese version of the SPOCQ instrument (SPOCQ-C) yields reliable and valid data when used with gifted and general Chinese students at the secondary level; to determine what motivational factors as measured by the SPOCQ-C instrument contribute to predicting the mathematics achievement of secondary students in China; and to investigate differences in the perceptions of gifted and general students, and male and female students. Participants included 486 gifted students and 580 general students from two secondary schools in China. Internal consistency reliability estimates and confirmatory factor analyses revealed that SPOCQ-C consisted of five factors measured by 34 items, the same as its original version. Although the sample could hardly represent the whole population of Chinese secondary students, it was heterogeneous in that it included students from two cities located in mid and south China, and gifted students who were enrolled in regular classes and in self-contained classes. Results of this study provided preliminary evidence in using the instrument with heterogeneous Chinese students at the secondary level. Structural equation modeling approaches were used to examine the causal relationships between the five factors and students' mathematics achievement. Results demonstrated that within students' Zone of Proximal Development, students' perceived levels of challenge directly predicted their mathematics performance. Students' self-efficacy beliefs not only influenced their learning but also predicted their mathematics achievement. Gifted students tended to have higher achievement in mathematics when they saw connections between what they learned and what they experienced in real life. Measurement invariance testing revealed that items on SPOCQ-C functioned equivalently across gifted and general students, and across male and female students. Further mean comparisons provided evidence that gifted students in mixed-ability classes perceived significantly higher levels of challenge and self-efficacy in mathematics classes than their general peers. Besides higher levels of challenge and self-efficacy, gifted students in self-contained classes perceived their mathematics classes to be as appealing as and have more choices than gifted students in regular classes.

          "dc:description": "This text performs reading for teaching in an audit culture. Two teachers, myself and Steven, read the memoir \u0026quot;Hole in My Life\u0026quot; by Jack Gantos and, while reading, recorded our experiences as readers and planned to teach the book to Steven\u0026apos;s English class. This study is an inquiry into the phenomenon of \u0026quot;reading to teach,\u0026quot; particularly how this mode of reading at once deploys and departs from other modes of reading, such as aesthetic, efferent, and critical postures of engagement. In its anticipation of teaching, this text teaches about how teachers read texts, the aesthetic contours of pedagogy, and how readers and teachers negotiate of inner vision with outer form. I have chosen to write what follows as a kind of memoir that reflects the primary mode of expression offered by the memoir that we read and taught. This research memoir, an elaborated phenomenology, recounts and thinks through what happened as we read, planned, and taught the text. This is also an account of an intellectual, teaching relationship that has taught me much in return about collaboration, what it means to read, and what it means to teach. As Taubman argues (2009), audit cultures in which teachers currently practice minimize opportunities for sustained reflection and thoughtful collaboration. As the time and rhythms of teaching are more externally monitored and controlled through testing and teaching-by-numbers curriculum guides, it becomes difficult to reflect on and practice through ambiguous but vital pedagogical questions. What does it mean to read books in solitude and with others? What responsibilities, possibilities or anxieties does the pedagogical relation offer to (or demand of) reading? How does reflective reading, teaching and research--in the context of friendship--see beyond the limits of audit culture? In what ways are teachers always, already performing these limitations even as they desire to disrupt them? This study raises such questions. I hope that the reader of this text may find it generative of new ways of creating a classroom as a commonplace: a place of common reading occasioned by and leading to deepened understanding of what we can know together.

          "dc:description": "Community colleges in the state of Missouri began to offer a two-year degree known as the Associate of Arts in Teaching (AAT) in 2007. Because this was a new degree for the state and only a few other states in the nation offered the degree, community colleges in Missouri were eager to measure the efficacy of the degree. The purpose of this mixed-method study was to determine if AAT graduates from this Midwestern community college were successful when they transferred to a four-year institution to continue their education and complete a baccalaureate degree. The participants of this study were AAT completers and the cooperating teachers who hosted them during their clinical field experience. Additional grade point information was provided by the three primary receiving transfer institutions. The independent variable was the completion of an AAT program. The qualitative components were the AAT completers' and cooperating teachers' perceptions collected via mail survey of students in the AAT program. The quantitative dependent variables were the AAT completers' attainment of higher than a 2.5 grade point average on a 4.0 scale after the completion of the first semester of transfer to a baccalaureate institution and the achievement of higher than a 2.5 GPA on a 4.0 scale during the culminating clinical student teaching experience at the baccalaureate institution. The final dependent variable was the rating by both AAT completers and their host teachers on surveys where they rated their satisfaction with AAT preparation based upon the eleven Missouri Standards for Teacher Education Programs (MoSTEP) using a 4-point Likert scale. The investigational methodology utilized was a positive one-sample, one-tail t-test with a confidence interval of 95 percent. The research contained multiple data sets of both qualitative and quantitative data, and all data supported the hypothesis that the AAT had a positive impact on successful transfer of AAT graduates to four-year institutions. Implications from this study suggested that the AAT is a beneficial degree for community colleges to offer, and community colleges in other states could benefit from the data acquired in completion of this study. Partnerships between two and four-year institutions in teacher education have become increasingly more common, and the AAT ensures a standardization of the component of the educational program offered at the community college level.

          "dc:description": "As the amount of information available in online digital libraries increases exponentially, questions arise concerning the most productive way to use that information to advance learning. Applying the earlier information seeking theories advocated by Kelly (1963), Taylor (1968), and Belkin (1980) to the digital libraries experience, Carol Kuhlthau created the inquiry-based information search process (ISP) model. This ISP model describes thoughts, actions and feelings in six stages of inquiry: initiation, selection, exploration, formulation, collection, and presentation. This study investigated the value of an organized educational digital library in supporting and improving English Foreign Language (EFL) student's critical thinking skills. The study also considered if critical thinking skills and English language skills can be improved simultaneously in the appropriate learning environment. A quasi-experimental pretest/posttest design was utilized. Participants were 98 Taiwanese freshmen majoring in Applied English. Two groups were compared in their ability to cultivate critical thinking. One approach used traditional open access to information plus training in critical thinking. The other used a structured approach to accessing and organizing information from an online digital library as well as training in critical thinking. A One-Way ANCOVA and an Independent-Samples t-test were used to examine the two groups on their 1) critical thinking skills, 2) English reading comprehension, and 3) attitudes in EFL classrooms. Bivariate correlation was employed to evaluate the relation between critical thinking and English reading comprehension. Results indicated that the experimental digital library group (M = 11.69) significantly outperformed the traditional group (M = 10.61) in critical thinking; F (1, 95) = 4.10, p \u0026lt; 0.05. The digital library group (M = 11.69) also outperformed the traditional group (M = 10.23) on English reading comprehension; F (1, 95) = 14.72, p \u0026lt; 0.05. There was a positive relationship between critical thinking and English reading comprehension (r = 0.212), p \u0026lt; 0.05. Also, students in the digital library group (M = 38.57), had better learning attitudes toward the intervention training program than did the control group (M = 35.59); t (96) = 2.48, p \u0026lt; 0.05. Students who used structured search strategies with digital libraries had higher critical thinking performance and more positive attitudes toward their learning experience. Educators should adopt training strategies that engage learners in every stage of inquiry process, from identifying a topic and selecting what to investigate, to formulating a focused perspective and presenting their final product. Further studies are needed to determine if the benefits of structured search strategies with digital libraries extends to other settings, cultures and grade levels. Collecting and analyzing examples of student projects may provide additional insights into the development of critical thinking skills.

ALE directors were surveyed using a self-administered questionnaire during January 2011. The results of 108 directors were analyzed to determine the structures' frequency of implementation using means, standard deviations, and ranges. Five separate ANOVAs and two T-Tests were used to compare the effect of the variables to the structures. Directors reported the most utilized structure was Reading as Thinking, and the least utilized was Integrated Units. However, the difference was small and all structures were used occasionally. Directors also reported there was no main effect significant between the structures based upon the variables of program size, location, and director's level of degree. However, directors with higher student-teacher ratios, between 11 and 38 to one, are more likely to report the activities of Authentic Experiences rather than directors with the lower student-teacher ratios between one and five to one. Female directors were more likely than male directors to report the activities of Small Groups, Reading as Thinking, and Representing to Learn. Directors without an administrative license are more likely to report activities of Authentic Experiences than directors holding an administrative license. Directors with seven to twenty years of experience are more likely to report the activities of Reading as Thinking and Representing to Learn rather than directors of experience of one to two years. Directors with three to twenty years of experience are more likely to report the activities of Classroom Workshop rather than directors of experience of one to two years.

This study examined the effects of Reading Recovery, an early literacy intervention, on the achievement gap of American Indians and their non- American Indian peers. Reading Recovery data from a training center encompassing a five state region were analyzed to determine the effects on the achievement gap. Two subtasks of the Observation Survey of Early Literacy Achievement were used to measure achievement at the beginning and end of the first-grade year of American Indian and non-American Indian students who had participated in Reading Recovery. Results of t tests of the mean scores in the fall indicated that the American Indians scored lower than the non-American Indians on both tasks. Differences in fall scores between groups were accounted for by adjusting spring scores using analyses of covariance. Differences in adjusted mean spring scores between the two groups were not statistically significant except for one subtest in one year out of the five years studied, showing that Reading Recovery narrowed or eliminated the gap for both American Indian and non-American Indians. Both groups started in the below average range in the fall and were at the average range in the spring after an intervention of 20 weeks or less. Students who start behind must experience accelerated learning in order to catch up with their peers and reach the average of their class. While both groups experienced accelerated learning, the American Indian students actually accelerated at a faster pace than their non-American Indian peers as evidenced in their higher spring mean scores and adjusted mean scores on one or the other of the subtasks during four of the five years studied. This study examined two groups that narrowed the achievement gap and compared how alike/different their journeys were. This adds to the research base confirming positive benefits of Reading Recovery with minority students (Batten, 2004; Rodgers, Wang, \u0026amp; Gomez-Bellenge, 2004). Reading Recovery helps close the achievement gap of minority and majority students and the gap between them.

          "dc:description": "In July of 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) determined that Massachusetts had violated the civil rights of its English Language Learners (ELLs) by placing them in classes with inadequately prepared teachers. Massachusetts is the contextual background for this study but it also serves as an example of the challenges across the U.S. in preparing teachers to meet the diverse needs of the growing population of ELLs within a national context of increasingly standardized curriculum and testing. The U.S. Secretary of Education, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Education, policy makers, teacher educators, and academics are all looking to educational research for answers to the current challenges. There are many answers or approaches coming from multiple discourses of educational research. However, as has been demonstrated in Massachusetts, research-based approaches to educational challenges are not always successful. More needs to be understood about how these approaches are actually taken up in classrooms. Unfortunately, there is limited research about teachers' understandings and uses of different discourses of research. In this dissertation I have explored how two urban ESL teachers engaged with research at different stages of their professional development. The questions that guide this study focused on how the teachers made meaning of research and enacted research during the three stages of the study: their master's program, their ESL practicum and a site visit two years after graduation. I conducted two longitudinal case studies drawing on constructivist grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006). Building on the findings from my literature review of ESL teachers' engagement with research I collected and analyzed data from the three stages mentioned above over a five-year period. Multiple phases of analysis included critical incident analysis (Angelides, 2001), and text analysis (Fairclough, 1992; 2003; Janks, 2005). The findings of this study show that while the teachers engaged in multiple ways with research, certain types and discourses of research discouraged teachers from meeting the needs of their students. The teachers' engagement with research as praxis (Lather, 1986) was complex but entailed change-enhancing engagement with theory, practice, and action that not only met students' needs, but promoted socially just teaching.

          "dc:description": "Substantial changes to the undergraduate population at US universities have created a need for the development of a model of academic literacy and a corresponding means of measuring academic readiness that addresses contextualized, communicative English language competence. This paper presents a unified model of academic literacy which treats language competence and academic writing skills within a single contextualized framework. This model was then used to develop a writing assessment which evaluates writing products written by both native and non-native speaking populations within an undergraduate required English course. Academic literacy refers to the attainment of the communicative competence required for the student to gain membership in the university discourse community. As a construct which requires membership within the academic discourse community, academic literacy entails communicative competence. Researchers have found that academic writing is primarily composed of tasks which engage students with existing information and ask them to respond critically in a way that demonstrates learning (Hinkel, 2009). The unified model takes into account the central nature of these kinds of writing tasks to university success. A program completion task was developed with respect to the established criteria based on the unified model. Successful completion of the exit task confirms that the student is able to meet the academic writing demands typically encountered in US university coursework; the assessment addresses language competence and effective implementation of academic writing skills as defined by the common core state standards initiative for ELA and repeated in required university English course curricula. In other words, the exit task evaluated by the established assessment criteria determines whether the student exhibits academic readiness, a construct which addresses situated communicative competence. The assessment was validated and determined to be a reliable tool for assessing academic readiness of native and non-native speakers of English, informing decisions to promote students to academic study. In addition to use as an exit test, the rating scale will be used in the ESL classroom to clearly articulate and motivate effective preparation for academic writing tasks by non-native speakers in IEPs.

          "dc:description": "Effective evidence-based action requires getting the right data into the right hands at the right time to help make decisions. The Data Quality Campaign (2011) has provided suggestions to state education agencies for effectively using data within state longitudinal data systems. One suggestion is to identify \u0026quot;the variety of ways available data can be used and the types of analyses required to answer critical policy questions\u0026quot;. In addition to answering policy questions, publicly available data sources have the potential to assist educators, policy makers, and other education stakeholders in Hawai'i with making evidence-based decisions related to education policy, programming, and support. As such, this document provides guidance to education researchers on how to access publicly available data sources, the questions that can be supported by the data sources, and the limitations of the data sources in order to support the advancement of education research and evidence-based decision making in Hawai'i. To identify available sources of publicly available data specific to Hawai'i, REL Pacific researchers solicited recommendations from 2013 Annual Hawaii Partnership for Educational Research Consortium (HPERC) Symposium attendees. REL Pacific researchers examined the list provided by the symposium attendees to identify data sources that were publicly available, Hawai'i-specific, and address at least one of HPERC's nine research priority areas (see Appendix A for the methods used to vet the data sources for inclusion in this document). The nine HPERC priority areas are: (1) Teacher training; (2) Technology-supported curriculum/use of technology in the classroom; (3) English language learner services and support; (4) Teacher evaluation; (5) Graduation rate; (6) Model schools/best practices; (7) NCLB requirement waivers/redefining school success; (8) Instructional time; and (9) Special education services. The data sources included in this document are divided into state and national data sources. Of the 11 state data sources, the Hawaii State Department of Education maintains four, Kamehameha Schools houses three, and the University of Hawai'i (UH) manages four. For the national data sources, the Department of Education maintains two data sources, Department of Health and Human Services houses two data sources, the Department of Labor maintains one data source, the National Science Foundation maintains one data source, and the U.S. Census Bureau houses one data source, totaling seven national data sources. In total, in-depth information on 18 publicly available, Hawai'i-specific data sources that can be used by education researchers to address at least one of HPERC's nine research priority areas is provided in this document. The following are appended: (1) Methodology; (2) Data Source Table; (3) Accountability Data Center; (4) College and Career Readiness Indicators Reports; (5) Hawaii Public Schools Reports for IDEA Part B; (6) Strive HI Performance System; (7) After Graduation Plan for KS Class of 2006; (8) Native Hawaiian Educational Attainment Charts; (9) No Child Left Behind, 2004; (10) Center on the Family Data Center; (11) Hawai'i School Health Survey: Youth Risk Behavior Survey; (12) Institutional Research and Analysis Office; (13) KIDS COUNT Data Center; (14) State Education Data Profiles (Common Core of Data); (15) 2009-10 \u0026amp; 2011-12 District or School Reports (Civil Rights Data Collection); (16) Detailed Data Tables (Civil Rights Data Collection); (17) State and National Estimations (Civil Rights Data Collection); (18) National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs; (19) National Survey of Children's Health; (20) Special Tabulations of U.S. Census Data--Limited English Proficiency; (21) Science and Engineering Indicators 2014 State Data Tool; and (22) U.S. Census Bureau's 2008-2012 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.",

          "dc:description": "In the hotel industry, social media marketing has become a new trend hoteliers are chasing and an increasing number of hotels are using social media to promote their business. However, the marketing effectiveness of social media is still a big challenge in both academic and business world. Since social media marketing is totally different from traditional marketing approaches, traditional marketing theories and practices may not be applicable to social media. Besides, very few studies have examined the effectiveness of social media marketing in the academic world. Therefore, this study intended to provide an in-depth examination on the marketing effectiveness of Facebook, the most commonly used social media site, in the hotel industry. The study explored the marketing effectiveness of Facebook from both customer and message perspectives. From the customer perspective, the antecedents of marketing effectiveness were analyzed through an online survey. From a message perspective, different types of messages posted on hotel Facebook pages by hotels were categorized and the marketing effectiveness of different messages was compared using an experiment design. Finally, combining antecedents with outcomes, the study proposed an integrative model of hotel Facebook marketing mechanism. To achieve these objectives, the study used mixed methods and was comprised of three sub-studies. The first sub-study employed an online survey to understand the antecedents that drive people to join hotel Facebook pages. The sub-study proposed three competing theoretical models, technology model, communication model, and social psychology model, to compare the extent to which the three models can explain customers\u0026apos; intention to join hotel Facebook pages. The social psychology model was tested to be the best model and three factors were identified to influence customers\u0026apos; intention to join hotel Facebook pages. Among them, internalization and identification had positive effects while compliance had a negative effect. Thus, Facebook marketing was more like a social phenomenon influenced by social interactions than a simple technology innovation or a communication platform. The second sub-study was a qualitative study that uses content analysis to collect data from 12 sample hotel brand Facebook pages and develop a classification of messages posted on hotel Facebook pages by hotels. A 4-type message format and 6-type message content classification was identified. In terms of message format, picture was more marketing effective than word, web link and video formats. In terms of message content, brand, product, and involvement messages had better marketing effectiveness than promotion, information, and reward messages. Promotion message was the worst message content type in terms of marketing effectiveness. Thus, Facebook works best for hotels to build brands, introduce new products, and interact with customers, while it is not a good platform for hotels to announce promotions and deals. The third sub-study conducted an online experiment to compare the marketing effectiveness of different types of messages on hotel Facebook pages. A 3 x 3 two-factor (message format and message content) between-subjects design was employed. Word, picture, and web link were chosen as the message format levels. Brand, product, and involvement were chosen as the message content levels. A hotel brand \u0026quot;Starhill\u0026quot; was created and nine simulated hotel Facebook pages with nine different types of messages were developed. Participants were randomly assigned to read one Facebook page with one type of message and then complete a questionnaire on message marketing effectiveness. Significant interaction effects were found on attitude toward the hotel Facebook page, hotel booking intention, and electronic word-of-mouth. Picture messages are better than word and web link messages in generating positive attitudes among customers, while word and web link messages do better in inducing more customer intentions. Besides, Brand messages work better in picture format while product messages do better in word and web link formats. This study had both theoretical and practical significance. Theoretically, this study was one of the first attempts about marketing effectiveness of social media using mixed methods and tried to identify the underlying theoretical models of social media marketing in the hospitality field. The integrated model of hotel Facebook marketing mechanism proposed in the study represents an important advancement in the theoretical research regarding social media marketing, particularly in the hotel industry context. Practically, this study can be used as a guideline for Facebook usage in the hotel industry. The study provided the hotel industry two types of suggestions in leverage Facebook marketing. On the customer side, hotels should reinforce their customers\u0026apos; social identity on their hotel Facebook pages through the creation of a social community and create message contents conforming to the norms and value systems of customers. On the message side, hotels should balance Facebook message format and carefully choose the best message format based on the message content and the purpose of the messages. In terms of message content, brand, product, and involvement messages should be the first choices of hotel Facebook messages. Hotels should avoid using promotion messages a lot.

          "dc:description": "Despite comprising only a small fraction of all vocational education and training (VET) in Schools enrolments, programs that count towards both national VET qualifications and university entry potentially fill an important role in the upper-secondary school curriculum. The aim of this study is to take a first step in gaining an understanding of the efficacy of VET in Schools courses by estimating the relationship between enrolling in Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) VET subjects and university access. The authors chose to examine the outcomes from VCE VET courses because they represent a model of assessment, known as \u0026quot;scored VET\u0026quot;, that closely resembles that applied in general courses. In particular, the assessment involves both written exams and numerical assessment of performance in job-specific tasks associated with units of competency. In this study, the analysis is carried out on a sample of school completers in Victoria in 2011 who lodged a first preference for enrolment in a university course prior to sitting their final year exams. To meet the aim of this study, the following key research questions are addressed: (1) What is the relationship between taking a Victorian Certificate of Education VET subject and university entry scores?; (2) To what extent is any relationship explained by scores in VCE VET subjects (direct effect) as opposed to scores in all other subjects taken by VCE VET students (indirect effect)?; (3) Does any relationship depend upon the type of VCE VET subject chosen?; (4) What is the relationship between participating in VCE VET subjects and the chances of being offered a place at university?; and (5) What is the relationship between participating in VCE VET subjects and the chances of attaining a first, third or sixth university entry preference? It was found that among students who intend to go to university, controlling for a range of differences between those who do and who do not take a VCE VET subject, that those who take a VCE VET subject have a six-point lower score on average than those who do not take a VCE VET subject (111 compared with 117 out of a possible 205). This represents around a 5% lower university entry score on average and is robust to the range of alternative key assumptions that underpin the analysis. Across VCE VET subject groupings, the authors found some variation in magnitude of the estimated negative association, with significant negative associations found in four of the seven subject groupings (engineering and technology; community, outdoor and recreation; hospitality; information technology) and no statistically significant negative results found for the rest (business and finance; dance and music; equine industry). Importantly, the authors stress that this study only examines the impacts of taking VCE VET subjects on direct access to university. Other important outcomes from VCE VET programs, such as indirect access to university (for example, by completing a diploma course), participation in post-school VET study, retention in post-school study, and employment outcomes are not investigated here, but should be considered in any overall evaluation of these programs. The following are appended: (1) Assessment; (2) VCE VET subjects; (3) Technical appendix; (4) Probit results and balancing test results; and (5) Sensitivity analysis.",
