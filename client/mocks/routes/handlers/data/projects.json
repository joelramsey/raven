The one trumpeted to repeal and replace Obamacare. The one that he had seven years to work on. The one he hid under lock and key in the basement of Congress. The one that had to be pulled to prevent the embarrassment of not having enough votes to pass.\"\nAfter the Republicans' monumental failure last week to repeal and replace Obamacare and hand Trump a key victory in his presidency's first 100 days, all eyes in Washington are on the relationship between the President and speaker, a political odd couple who seemingly forged an amiable alliance after a rocky presidential campaign, and whose unique skills -- Trump the ultimate closer and Ryan the policy guru -- seemed to complement one another.\nOn Sunday morning, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told Chris Wallace on \"Fox News Sunday\" that the President's tweet to tune into a show that would skewer Ryan was merely \"coincidental,\" and that Trump was trying to do his friend Pirro a favor, not insinuate Ryan should resign. \n\"He doesn't blame Paul Ryan,\" Priebus said. \"In fact, he thought Paul Ryan worked really hard. He enjoys his relationship with Paul Ryan, thinks that Paul Ryan is a great speaker of the House.\"\nRyan spokesman Doug Andres told CNN that Trump spoke with Ryan on Sunday morning and \"the President was clear his tweet had nothing to do with the speaker. They are both eager to get back to work on the agenda.\"\nThat conversation followed an hour-long call Saturday, in which the President and speaker discussed about how to move forward on their shared policy goals, Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said.\n\"Their relationship is stronger than ever right now,\" Strong told CNN.\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney also doubled down Sunday morning on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" saying, \"Never once have I seen (Trump) blame Paul Ryan.\"\nBoth publicly and behind the scenes, Trump's deepest frustrations appear to be directed not at Ryan, but at the conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus, whom he spent last week trying to negotiate with.\n\"Democrats are smiling in D.C. that the Freedom Caucus, with the help of Club For Growth and Heritage, have saved Planned Parenthood \u0026 Ocare!,\" Trump tweeted Sunday morning.\nThe White House had offered the Freedom Caucus an 11th-hour deal to repeal an Obamacare requirement that insurers cover essential health care benefits, such as prescription drugs and hospital stays, to get them on board. \nBut members of the group argued that that alone wouldn't do enough to reduce premiums. The Freedom Caucus wanted a lot more, including the scrapping popular Obamacare provisions, such as allowing children to stay on their parents' insurance until they are 26 and requiring insurers to cover pre-existing conditions, both of which Trump had promised during the campaign that he wouldn't touch. \nAs the negotiations progressed, the White House became aware of the schisms within the GOP ranks, which festered for years and led Ryan's predecessor, House Speaker John Boehner, to step down. \nBut the White House thought things might be different now, with a Republican President in office and a real opportunity to deliver on a seven-year campaign promise.\n\"We underestimated the acrimony inside the caucus\" a senior White House official told CNN adding that they had wrongly assumed the Freedom Caucus would act differently than it had in the past given Trump's popularity in members' districts.\n\"It wasn't about the policy,\" the official said. \"It didn't matter what policy we made because they didn't want a deal. We were captives in an internal House caucus fight. The Freedom Caucus had too much interest in killing this to send a message to Speaker Ryan: 'You have too much power.'\"\nFor now, Ryan and Trump's relationship appears intact, which will be key to ensuring the next legislative lift, tax reform, gets passed by the House.\nBut one tell on how things are going will be how much the White House outsources the legislative process to Ryan and Capitol Hill the next time around.\n\"We learned a lot about loyalty,\" Trump said after the bill was withdrawn Friday. \"We learned a lot about some very arcane rules in, obviously, both the Senate and in the House. So, it's been certainly, for me, it's been a very interesting experience.\"\n",

Please set aside your preconceptions and assumptions about young people who don’t finish high school. Fight the instinct to reach for quick solutions. Just listen hard and try to understand their experience and perspective. Young people who don’t finish high school have few avenues for sharing their stories with adults, school professionals, community leaders, and policymakers. The goal of this report is to change that — to raise up the voices of young people who have not graduated from high school so that we all gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and choices they face. W ith enthusiastic support from our partners at Target, the research team at our Center for Promise set out to discover what young people say about the experiences that lead them away from high school. By conducting interviews with more than 200 young people and surveying several thousand more, we listened deeply to what leads to leaving school before graduation. Throughout the process, our goal remained the same — to hear what young people say about their lives and decisions. Readers of this report know the challenge our nation faces now: Approximately 20 percent of young people — about 800,000 per year— don’t graduate from high school. We at America’s Promise and our Alliance of partners and communities are dedicated to reducing that number dramatically. Together with the President and the Secretary of Education, we’ve set a goal of raising the graduation rate from its current 80 percent to 90 percent by 2020. All of us — individuals, organizations, communities — share the responsibility and opportunity for creating the conditions under which all young people have a real chance to thrive. We make choices every day that can ease the path young people walk or make that path more difficult. These decisions should be informed by the voices and realities of the teens we want to support. We can’t help them meet their own goals if we don’t understand the lives they lead, the challenges they face and the perspectives they bring. One small and important way for us to start changing course is captured in the title of this report. Let’s grant the wish expressed in several of the group interviews to stop calling this group of young people “dropouts.” Let’s leave behind the “loser” and “quitter” undertones that word conveys. And then let’s get to work helping to build a future in which all young people can flourish and thrive. John Gomperts President and CEO, America's Promise Alliance Join the conversation and read the whole report at GradNation.org/NotDropouts and on Twitter using #notdropouts. 3 A MESSAGE FROM T ARGET The eduation achievement gap — or opportunity gap, as many have suggested—is not made up of statistics, it is made up of people; students — children — with hopes and dreams and challenges all their own. To paint them with a broad brush is to marginalize them. To render them merely as numbers is to refuse to see their faces, or hear their voices, or honor their stories. In this compelling new report, “Don’t Call Them Dropouts,” America’s Promise Alliance gives voice to the young people behind the numbers. These are the students who’ve left school behind for reasons that are often as reasonable as they are devastating. And they are coming back, or trying to, because these students have one thing in common: the desire to create better lives than the ones they have been given. W e are proud to sponsor this report. At Target, we have always believed that meaningful, lasting solutions begin with listening. Empathy is at the heart of all great, human-centered design. This is the approach we take to designing experiences for our guests, and to making investments in our communities. Our commitment to education is built on a simple belief: thatdeserves a quality education regardless of race or socioeconomic status. It’s why we’ve committed $1 billion to the cause; an investment we’ll reach by the end of 2015. It’s why we give 5% of our profit — that’s more than $4 million every week — and more than a million volunteer hours in 2013 from our team members nationwide. It’s why we use our strengths as a national retailer to foster public/private part- nerships, convene cross-sector leaders, and raise awareness of education. And it’s why we support strong, action-oriented partners like America’s Promise Alliance. We also believe nothing is more important to the future of our children, communities and country than education. It is the key to moving young people out of poverty and into economic opportunity. It ensures they’ll have the knowledge and skills to compete in a 21st century global economy. And it’s critical to ensuring that we have a skilled workforce and leaders for the future. There’s good news to celebrate. Graduation rates are on the rise. Every year, fewer children are leaving school before graduation. But too many still do. And to read their stories is to understand in a whole new way just how much work remains. We still have cross-sector partnerships to build, solutions to design, and young people to engage. This report is a good place to start. If we are to help our children in the gap, we must first understand them. Their future — and, indeed, our own future — depend on it. Respectfully, Laysha Ward President, Community Relations Target 4 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The Center for Promise at America’s Promise Alliance could not have completed this study without our partners, includ- ing a group of community-based organizations throughout the country, national leaders on the issues that impact young people, and the young people who agreed to be interviewed and surveyed. Their generous contributions of time and talent shaped Don’t Call Them Dropouts from beginning to end. The Center for Promise team that worked on this study is comprised of: • Jonathan F. Zaff, Ph.D., Executive Director • Ana Carvalho, Graduate Research Assistant • Elizabeth Pufall Jones, Ph.D., Research Scientist • Steven Otto, Graduate Research Assistant • Sara E.

She translated complex quantitative and qualitaive methodologies and findings into a compelling narrative that is true to the voices of the young people we interviewed and surveyed. America’s Promise Alliance gratefully acknowledges the generous support of Target for this study and its dissemination. 5 FOREWORD There is power in listening. Almost a decade ago, we discovered with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that notwith- standing years of research on the high school dropout problem, no one had ever talked with the customers of American education — the non-graduates themselves. When we listened to their perspectives in focus groups and a national survey in 25 cities, suburbs and rural areas across the United States, a powerful story started to emerge, one we captured in 2006 in The Silent Epidemic: Perspectives of High School Dropouts. Like other students, those who left school without diplomas had big dreams for their futudultswantead to have higher expectations for them, saw the importance of high school and college to their careers, and were confident they could have graduated. Yet, many saw little connection between what happened in the classroom and what they wanted to be in life. Often, attendance patterns were a clear and early warning sign, academic challenges grew, school seemed to be irrelevant to their career dreams, and the weight of real world events pulled them away. In hindsight, with jobs to find and families to raise, the vast majority said that leaving high school was one of the worst decisions of their lives. For a variety of reasons, this problem was hidden from the American people or thought to be chronically unfixable. The Silent Epidemic told us more about who these young people were, why they dropped out of high school, and what steps could help others graduate and go on to college. We learned that the dropout epidemic is fixable and young people point the way forward. While these students took responsibility for their own decisions, they longed for: stronger connections between school and work; improved and more engaging instruction; access to supports they needed; a safe and welcoming school climate that fostered learning; a strong relationship with at least one adult in the school; and improved communication between parents and schools before it was too late. These findings were crucial blocks on which to build better supports for students. A decade later, America’s Promise Alliance and Tufts University come roaring forward with a groundbreaking report that goes deeper with these young people. While it illuminates the family, social, and financial pressures that may cause a young person to stop school, this study also emphasizes the resilience and determination shared by these “dropouts” as they work to overcome extraordinarily difficult life circumstances. Their persistence in the face of many setbacks should encourage us that, if we continue to listen to their voices and work to put the right supports in place, we can help even more young people stay in school and on track to a successful future and help those who have left school return to graduate. Our nation is making important progress in reaching the GradNation goal of a 90 percent high school graduation rate nationwide by the Class of 2020. This is a goal that previous Presidents have set and missed. But our nation must not miss it this tim So lt’s listen to the perspectives, stories and insights shared in this new report and continue to galvanize a nation to respond. The futures of so many young people depend upon it. John M.

While a high school diploma is only a starting line for adult after leaving school, and what barriers do they encounter along the way? success, it has become increasingly clear that it is crucial for taking the next steps in college and career. Over the As we talked with young people, many of whom had already re-entered high school completion programs, we learned past decade, there has been impressive growth in and commitment to helping more students graduate. that they do not want to be called “dropouts.” Further, because the majority of survey respondents had already What has been missing from much of the recent research, returned to school, we avoid using traditional language however, is a vibrant portrait of young people’s experienceabout dropping out in this report.

See also Bridgeland, J. M., Milano, J. A. 2We refer to the two survey populations as “interrupted-enrollment” and “continuous-enrollment” throughout the document, to emphasize the point that “dropout” does not accurately describe the young people who left school and subsequently re-engaged in secondary education. See the tables in Appendix III for demographic information. 3That is, young people described themselves as survivors of violence, exposed to violence, affected by adverse health events in their families, or subject to school climates and policies that are unsafe, unsupportive or disrespectful. 7EXECUTIVE SUMMARY There are statistically significant differences between the interrupted- enrollment and continuously-enrolled survey respondents with respect to life circumstances. people.

Without denying the harm that some of these young people have done through violence, gangs, and drugs, we invite readers of this report to also see the resilient, determined, and hopeful community members our team met in the summer of 2013. The stories and the statistics provide important clues to how we can learn more from, and be more supportive of, the diverse groups of young people who are leaving our nation’s high schools. We strongly urge greater inclusion of young peop l’s perspectives into future policymaking, policy applications, and practical community-based interventions. Our research confirms that how each of us sees these young people, how we talk to them, and what we expect from them matters very much. 9 METHODOLOGY The study utilized an exploratory sequentiam l ixed-methods with America’s Promise.

What circumstances sur- rounded the decision to leave? • What were students’ lives like when they left school, and what effects has that decision had on them and on their families? • Why do young people say they come back to school? people seek and prioritize connections with adults • What opportunities do young people have to re-engage (parents, teachers, other family or community after leaving school, and what barriers do they members); peers; and/or younger family members (a encounter along the way? child, a sibling). The value placed on these relationships can lead young people toward or away from school, Listening to the voices of more than 200 young people in depending on other circumstances. sixteen different places gave the research team a vibrant • Persistent resilience (“bouncing back”) was evident picture of their experiences.

The sheer level of trust and intimacy that we developed in two hours enabled us to look beneath the surface to examine their lives. Their stories were filled with tensions between their learned strengths and weaknesses, their common threats and opportunities and most importantly their challenges and their triumphs. On the one hand, their stories revealed a downright ugly underbelly of our society and the experiences of these young people. Tales of physical, emotional, psychological abuse were shared; things that should not happen to people ever, let alone in the 21 century. On the other hand, the focus group participants’ stories inspired. Either way, the real tragedy is that these stories are usually not heard or listened to. Further, not enough of us are effectively intervening or acting toward changing the circumstances that push or pull young people out of school and down riskier pathways, just to meet their individual and family needs. It’s as if they’re living on Neptune. Their realities could not be any further from our own. That may be the reason they go to extraordinary measures to hide the uglier side of their lives. However, once the facts get uncovered we must respond appropriately. As we heard these incredible stories from the focus group participants many questions came to mind, some of which we asked immediately. Sometimes we’d ask, “Why didn’t you contact somebody who could possibly help?” The refrain became, “We did and that only made things worse,” or, “I did and they didn’t do anything.” Not only are these young people facing serious obstacles, but when they try to connect they often find themselves worse off than they were to begin with. Some of our institutions are not meeting their needs and sometimes create even greater impediments in the lives of these young people. There are, however, many institutions that are very helpful — and that is where we found hope. Hope is in the voices of these young people. It’s time we scale the walls that separate us, and authentically connect with young people. The calls and cries are numerous and they vary. We hear them in terms of economics or the number of students whose attendance is interrupted or the unemployment and crime rates. All of those things are important indicators, but what lies beneath is the stuff we must better understand. What can we really understand from our perspective? We can get a rudimentary picture but the masterpiece is what we need to see. The voofs those indicators make up the tape tries that come together to complete the masterpiece. I’d like to invite you to become a masterpiece creator and an ambassador for young people. I invite you to not make assump- tions about what young people need or want and to engage, connect to, play with, communicate with, adapt with and empower young people. Work with us to solve the ailments of our compromised society. In addition, we must understand that our young people won’t use terms taught in psychology and sociology courses. They will, however, speak a truth from a perspective we need to engage and include to better address the concerns and challenges they face and the skills and talents they bring to this work. Finally, I learned another thing from sitting in these focus groups, which I think is important to this whole movement/ campaign. I learned of the power of humility. In one respect, the young people who sat in those groups with us eceived unconditional support to and from their peers. 15THEMES AND FINDINGS | FINDINGS 1 Some of the most endearing moments happened when while sharing individual stories participants would soothe one another with gentle words of wisdom, provide tissues for tears, share resources and offer shoulders to lean on. Because each of them had been through hard times or made mistakes in their lives, they could better empathize with each other and recognize each other’s humanity. They re-asserted th",

        "text": "The Wyoming Department of Education (WDE) has invested time and money developing standardized achievement test score reports designed to give teachers data about each of their students' levels of mastery of particular concepts in order to differentiate their instruction. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which eighth-grade mathematics teachers used Traffic Signal Project Reports to analyze how teachers used data to differentiate instruction. A qualitative case study methodology was used in gathering data from teachers of similar backgrounds and school settings. This study focused on three research questions including how teachers used Traffic Signal Project Reports to inform their instruction, how teachers differentiated their instruction based on assessment data, and how teachers decided which sources of data they used to make instructional changes in the classroom. A panel of experts, seventh- and eighth-grade Wyoming math teachers, analyzed a set of interview questions and determined that they were adequate for the purpose of the case study. Questions focused on whether teachers used Traffic Signal Project Reports and/or other types of data to shape their instruction. The population of this study was middle school mathematics teachers located in Wyoming. Ten eighth-grade mathematics teachers from Title I schools and schools with similar demographics participated in the study. Results from the study showed that standardized test score data were used mostly for grouping students in classes by ability rather than used for differentiating instruction within the classroom. Also, teachers were more comfortable using their own classroom data pieces to differentiate instruction in the classroom rather than standardized achievement test score data. Furthermore, teachers utilized various forms of data to make instructional decisions such as class groupings or adjusting curriculum. The majority of the teachers either implied or stressed the need to utilize multiple sources of data before making instructional decisions. The teachers also indicated that the Traffic Signal Project Reports should be modified to make them more user-friendly for differentiation.

      "text": "\"Paul Ryan needs to step down as speaker of the House,\" Pirro said. \"The reason? He failed to deliver the votes on his health care bill. The one trumpeted to repeal and replace Obamacare. The one that he had seven years to work on. The one he hid under lock and key in the basement of Congress. The one that had to be pulled to prevent the embarrassment of not having enough votes to pass.\"\nAfter the Republicans' monumental failure last week to repeal and replace Obamacare and hand Trump a key victory in his presidency's first 100 days, all eyes in Washington are on the relationship between the President and speaker, a political odd couple who seemingly forged an amiable alliance after a rocky presidential campaign, and whose unique skills -- Trump the ultimate closer and Ryan the policy guru -- seemed to complement one another.\nOn Sunday morning, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told Chris Wallace on \"Fox News Sunday\" that the President's tweet to tune into a show that would skewer Ryan was merely \"coincidental,\" and that Trump was trying to do his friend Pirro a favor, not insinuate Ryan should resign. \n\"He doesn't blame Paul Ryan,\" Priebus said. \"In fact, he thought Paul Ryan worked really hard. He enjoys his relationship with Paul Ryan, thinks that Paul Ryan is a great speaker of the House.\"\nRyan spokesman Doug Andres told CNN that Trump spoke with Ryan on Sunday morning and \"the President was clear his tweet had nothing to do with the speaker. They are both eager to get back to work on the agenda.\"\nThat conversation followed an hour-long call Saturday, in which the President and speaker discussed about how to move forward on their shared policy goals, Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said.\n\"Their relationship is stronger than ever right now,\" Strong told CNN.\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney also doubled down Sunday morning on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" saying, \"Never once have I seen (Trump) blame Paul Ryan.\"\nBoth publicly and behind the scenes, Trump's deepest frustrations appear to be directed not at Ryan, but at the conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus, whom he spent last week trying to negotiate with.\n\"Democrats are smiling in D.C. that the Freedom Caucus, with the help of Club For Growth and Heritage, have saved Planned Parenthood \u0026 Ocare!,\" Trump tweeted Sunday morning.\nThe White House had offered the Freedom Caucus an 11th-hour deal to repeal an Obamacare requirement that insurers cover essential health care benefits, such as prescription drugs and hospital stays, to get them on board. \nBut members of the group argued that that alone wouldn't do enough to reduce premiums. The Freedom Caucus wanted a lot more, including the scrapping popular Obamacare provisions, such as allowing children to stay on their parents' insurance until they are 26 and requiring insurers to cover pre-existing conditions, both of which Trump had promised during the campaign that he wouldn't touch. \nAs the negotiations progressed, the White House became aware of the schisms within the GOP ranks, which festered for years and led Ryan's predecessor, House Speaker John Boehner, to step down. \nBut the White House thought things might be different now, with a Republican President in office and a real opportunity to deliver on a seven-year campaign promise.\n\"We underestimated the acrimony inside the caucus\" a senior White House official told CNN adding that they had wrongly assumed the Freedom Caucus would act differently than it had in the past given Trump's popularity in members' districts.\n\"It wasn't about the policy,\" the official said. \"It didn't matter what policy we made because they didn't want a deal. We were captives in an internal House caucus fight. The Freedom Caucus had too much interest in killing this to send a message to Speaker Ryan: 'You have too much power.'\"\nFor now, Ryan and Trump's relationship appears intact, which will be key to ensuring the next legislative lift, tax reform, gets passed by the House.\nBut one tell on how things are going will be how much the White House outsources the legislative process to Ryan and Capitol Hill the next time around.\n\"We learned a lot about loyalty,\" Trump said after the bill was withdrawn Friday. \"We learned a lot about some very arcane rules in, obviously, both the Senate and in the House. So, it's been certainly, for me, it's been a very interesting experience.\"\n",
