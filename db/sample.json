				"dc:description" : "The 2013 study, &quot;Evaluation of the College Possible Program: Results From a Randomized Controlled Trial&quot;, investigated the effect of the &quot;College Possible&quot; program, which is designed to serve low-income high school students by providing SAT/ACT test preparation, financial aid consulting, and college admissions guidance in an after-school setting. Using data from the ACT, the National Student Clearinghouse, and the &quot;College Possible&quot; program, researchers examined the impact of the program on ACT scores, college applications, and college enrollment. The study meets WWC group design standards with reservations. Overall college enrollment rates were the same in both groups (about 64%). Students in the intervention group enrolled in selective institutions at a higher rate than students in the comparison group (12% vs. 5%), but this difference was not statistically significant. The author did report that the proportion of students enrolling in a 4-year institution was higher for the intervention group (45% vs. 34%), but the WWC found that this effect was not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. The regression discontinuity (RD) design portion of this study did not meet WWC RD standards because the forcing variable does not have a sufficient number of unique values.

				"dc:description" : "&quot;Don't Call Them Dropouts&quot; adds to the large and growing body of research about why some young people fail to complete high school on the traditional four-year timeline. While a high school diploma is only a starting line for adult success, it has become increasingly clear that it is crucial for taking the next steps in college and career. Over the past decade, there has been impressive growth in and commitment to helping more students graduate. What has been missing from much of the recent research, however, is a vibrant portrait of young people's experiences, gathered in a way that deepens the national conversation about why some young people are still failing to graduate. The Center's research team gathered the stories of more than 200 young people through 30 facilitated group interviews in 16 high-poverty, geographically distributed urban communities across the country. In addition, nearly 3,000 more young people drawn from all 50 states responded to a survey; about two-thirds of those respondents had stopped attending school for at least a semester, while the remainder had finished high school uninterrupted. A group of partner organizations, described in Appendix II, assisted with recruiting participants for both qualitative and quantitative data collection. The research was designed to answer questions like: (1) What do young people say about why they leave high school before graduating; (2) What circumstances surrounded the decision to leave; (3) What were students' lives like when they left school, and what effects has that decision had on them and on their families; (4) Why do young people say they came back to school; (5) What opportunities do young people have to re-engage after leaving school, and what barriers do they encounter along the way? Analyzing the qualitative and quantitative data led to four primary findings: (1) Both disengaging from and re-engaging with school result from clusters of factors; (2) Young people who stop going to school are likely to be navigating home, school, or neighborhood environments that they experience as toxic; (3) Connectedness to others is a high priority for young people; The value placed on these relationships can lead young people away from or toward school, depending on other circumstances; and (4) Young people who interrupted their high school education often &quot;bounced back&quot; from difficult circumstances, but individual resilience was insufficient to re-engage with school. Longer-term positive development, called, &quot;reaching up,&quot; required additional support. The stories and the statistics provide important clues to how more can be learned how to provide more support of the diverse groups of young people who are leaving our nation's high schools. This research confirms that how each of us sees these young people, how we talk to them, and what we expect from them matters very much.

Classroom teachers rated each student's attentive behavior in a whole-class setting and tutors rated each student's attentive behavior in an intensive small-group setting. The sample was 131 fourth-grade students identified as at risk for developing mathematics difficulties (MD) and randomly assigned to fraction tutoring. Teachers and tutors rated each student's inattentive behavior in the 10th week of the 12-week intervention period. On average, tutors rated students as more attentive than teachers. Also, tutor ratings had greater predictive power than teacher ratings on fraction concepts, but neither set of ratings uniquely predicted performance on whole-number calculations. Possible explanations for findings and directions for future research are discussed. [Note: This content is a pre-print version of the article.]",

In this summative report, program effectiveness has been examined in three aspects, &quot;Noyce Scholar recruitment,&quot; &quot;institutional support for teacher preparation,&quot; and &quot;the concurrent impact on high-needs schools.&quot; The evaluation design conforms to a well-established model of Results-Based Accountability to address nine questions: (1) How much has been done in student recruitment? (2) How well did the program perform in student recruitment? (3) Did high-needs schools benefit from the Noyce Scholar recruitment? (4) How much has been done to meet STEM teacher requirements? (5) How well did the program do to enrich STEM learning opportunities? (6) Did the program benefit teacher preparation in high-needs schools? (7) How much has been accomplished in program support? (8) How well did the program do in grant administration? (9) Did the program benefit student learning in high-needs schools? Professional standards in teacher education have been incorporated to facilitate the triangulation of quantitative and qualitative data from Noyce Scholar surveys, interviews, and transcript analyses. Three recommendations are adduced to support teacher preparation during the no cost extension.",

The hands-on exploration occurred during a four-week summer section and involved two professors, two university student assistants, two K-12 teachers, and 18 high school students. Besides evaluating the REVS-UP impact, this report includes assessment of compelling evidence in program development across the levels of &quot;Intended Curriculum&quot;, &quot;Implemented Curriculum&quot;, and &quot;Attained Curriculum&quot;. Feedback from the community outreach events has been gathered to show significant improvement of service outcome over last year.

Data for this report were collected through an online questionnaire administered by districts in the SWTREC in April 2013 and completed by one person from each participating school. Seventeen of the twenty-one high schools within the SWTREC districts responded to the survey. More than 80 percent of responding schools reported offering online or distance-learning courses in school year 2012/13. On average, schools provided more online than distance-learning courses, and they had higher enrollments in online courses. Both online and distance-learning courses were used to provide students with access to dual enrollment courses. Schools that offered online courses most often identified the opportunity for students to accelerate credit accumulation as a &quot;very important&quot; reason for offering the courses. Technological limitations--both the availability of technology and restricted periods when technology was available--were barriers schools perceived in offering online and distance-learning courses.

				"dc:description" : "Most mathematics assignments consist of a group of problems requiring the same strategy. For example, a lesson on the quadratic formula is typically followed by a block of problems requiring students to use the quadratic formula, which means that students know the appropriate strategy before they read each problem. In an alternative approach, different kinds of problems appear in an interleaved order, which requires students to choose the strategy on the basis of the problem itself. In the classroom-based experiment reported here, grade seven students (n = 140) received blocked or interleaved practice over a nine-week period, followed two weeks later by an unannounced test. Mean test scores were greater for material learned by interleaved practice rather than by blocked practice (72% vs. 38%, d = 1.05). This interleaving effect was observed even though the different kinds of problems were superficially dissimilar from each other, whereas previous interleaved mathematics studies required students to learn nearly identical kinds of problems. We conclude that interleaving improves mathematics learning not only by improving discrimination between different kinds of problems but also by strengthening the association between each kind of problem and its corresponding strategy.

				"dc:description" : "Educational systems throughout the world serve students from diverse populations. Often students from minority populations (i.e. racial, ethnic, linguistic, cultural, economic) face unique challenges when learning in contexts based on the cultural traditions and learning theories of the majority population. These challenges often leave minority populations labeled as incompetent, unmotivated, and cognitively deficit. In the United States, African American female students are among minority populations who are often positioned as deficit when compared to the majority White population. This study investigates middle school African American female perceptions of themselves as learners and students' knowledge of the meaning of ratio, proportionality, and how to apply and explain their application of proportionality concepts by examining written problem solving strategies over a three-year period. Students' responses are analyzed according to the strategies they used to reach their final solution. The categories of strategies include no-response, guess and check, additive build up with and without a pictorial representation, and multiplicative. The majority of students in this study 86.5%, 69.2%, and 68.6% did not attempt or demonstrated no understanding in year one, two, and three respectively. Additionally, participants reported positive dispositions about themselves as mathematics learners. An appendix presents the &quot;Conceptual Understanding Scoring Rubric.&quot;",

While some teachers' use of electronic resources involves locating activities and lessons from various internet sites, textbook and educational software companies have begun to develop comprehensive programs that can supplement if not fully replace traditional paper textbooks. Digital platforms can be transformative, with possibilities for frequent updating, access to multimedia resources, connection to virtual communities, lower production and distribution costs, and customized instruction. However, there have been no attempts to analyze specific programs in mathematics education with respect to these and other features, a gap we seek to address. In this article, we developed and applied a framework to analyze a representative sample of digital curriculum programs in order to help educators better understand characteristics of these materials. We documented two distinct curriculum types, individualized learning programs and digitized versions of traditional textbooks. While the programs offered some of the features identified as transformative, particularly with respect to assessment systems that rapidly and visually report student performance, there were many features that did not take full advantage of the digital medium.",

Recent research indicates that perceptual learning (PL) interventions facilitate discovery of structure and recognition of patterns in mathematical domains, as assessed by tests of mathematical competence. Here we sought direct evidence that a brief perceptual learning module (PLM) produces changes in basic information extraction. Accuracy and speed of undergraduate participants' encoding of equations was assessed in a psychophysical task at pretest and delayed posttest. In between, the experimental group completed an &quot;Algebraic Transformations PLM,&quot; which involved identifying valid transformations of equations. Relative to controls, PLM participants showed reliable changes in encoding equations, detectable psychophysically 24 hours later. Encoding improvements were shown robustly by participants who were initially less proficient at algebra and were negligible for participants who were initially proficient. These results provide direct evidence for durable changes in information encoding produced by a PL intervention targeting a complex mathematical skill.",

Four types of factors influence student nonenrollment and absenteeism: student-specific, family-specific, school-specific, and community-specific. Many of these potential factors are interconnected, and the effects of these factors may vary by region. Therefore, educators, policymakers, and family and community members in the Pacific Region may need to gather additional data in order to explore these factors in their own communities. Stakeholders can also use this review to begin to identify the root causes for why students are not in school in order to develop and implement targeted strategies to support student enrollment and attendance.

				"dc:description" : "Effective evidence-based action requires getting the right data into the right hands at the right time to help make decisions. The Data Quality Campaign (2011) has provided suggestions to state education agencies for effectively using data within state longitudinal data systems. One suggestion is to identify &quot;the variety of ways available data can be used and the types of analyses required to answer critical policy questions&quot;. In addition to answering policy questions, publicly available data sources have the potential to assist educators, policy makers, and other education stakeholders in Hawai'i with making evidence-based decisions related to education policy, programming, and support. As such, this document provides guidance to education researchers on how to access publicly available data sources, the questions that can be supported by the data sources, and the limitations of the data sources in order to support the advancement of education research and evidence-based decision making in Hawai'i. To identify available sources of publicly available data specific to Hawai'i, REL Pacific researchers solicited recommendations from 2013 Annual Hawaii Partnership for Educational Research Consortium (HPERC) Symposium attendees. REL Pacific researchers examined the list provided by the symposium attendees to identify data sources that were publicly available, Hawai'i-specific, and address at least one of HPERC's nine research priority areas (see Appendix A for the methods used to vet the data sources for inclusion in this document). The nine HPERC priority areas are: (1) Teacher training; (2) Technology-supported curriculum/use of technology in the classroom; (3) English language learner services and support; (4) Teacher evaluation; (5) Graduation rate; (6) Model schools/best practices; (7) NCLB requirement waivers/redefining school success; (8) Instructional time; and (9) Special education services. The data sources included in this document are divided into state and national data sources. Of the 11 state data sources, the Hawaii State Department of Education maintains four, Kamehameha Schools houses three, and the University of Hawai'i (UH) manages four. For the national data sources, the Department of Education maintains two data sources, Department of Health and Human Services houses two data sources, the Department of Labor maintains one data source, the National Science Foundation maintains one data source, and the U.S. Census Bureau houses one data source, totaling seven national data sources. In total, in-depth information on 18 publicly available, Hawai'i-specific data sources that can be used by education researchers to address at least one of HPERC's nine research priority areas is provided in this document. The following are appended: (1) Methodology; (2) Data Source Table; (3) Accountability Data Center; (4) College and Career Readiness Indicators Reports; (5) Hawaii Public Schools Reports for IDEA Part B; (6) Strive HI Performance System; (7) After Graduation Plan for KS Class of 2006; (8) Native Hawaiian Educational Attainment Charts; (9) No Child Left Behind, 2004; (10) Center on the Family Data Center; (11) Hawai'i School Health Survey: Youth Risk Behavior Survey; (12) Institutional Research and Analysis Office; (13) KIDS COUNT Data Center; (14) State Education Data Profiles (Common Core of Data); (15) 2009-10 &amp; 2011-12 District or School Reports (Civil Rights Data Collection); (16) Detailed Data Tables (Civil Rights Data Collection); (17) State and National Estimations (Civil Rights Data Collection); (18) National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs; (19) National Survey of Children's Health; (20) Special Tabulations of U.S. Census Data--Limited English Proficiency; (21) Science and Engineering Indicators 2014 State Data Tool; and (22) U.S. Census Bureau's 2008-2012 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.",

Therefore, this research aims to determine the variables influencing the motivational strategies used by non-native English teachers in Turkish context. 122 non-native English teachers teaching English at a state-run university prep school participated in this research and Motivational Strategies Questionnaire prepared by Cheng &amp; Dörnyei (2007) was used as a data collection instrument. The questionnaire was composed of two sections. In the first section, demographic data were collected about the gender, years of experience, types of schools served and the state of attendance abroad of the participants. The second section involved ten scales and totally 48 items ranging from often to never. The results of the study revealed that English teachers used each motivational strategy more than average and there was no significant difference between motivational strategy use and gender, the year of experience, the type of school of served and the state of attendance abroad. An appendix presents the Motivational Strategy Questionnaire (Cheng and Dörnyei, 2007) Scale and Constituents.",

				"dc:description" : "In this exploratory study the researchers examined examine the value of exposure to the spelling and pronunciation of word forms when introducing the meanings of new and difficult vocabulary words. Researchers randomly assigned kindergarten English learners to one of two types of storybook reading delivered by tutors. Students received individual storybook reading. Students in both treatments listened to short stories containing novel target words. In both groups, students were told the meanings of the difficult words when they first appeared in the stories. However, in one of the groups (Definitions-Plus), students were also shown the printed words when they first appeared in the stories, and were asked to pronounce and spell the words aloud. Vocabulary learning was assessed with three researcher-designed measures including receptive vocabulary, vocabulary definitions, and spelling. Results showed that both groups made significant gains on all three custom measures, with average gains of 8%, 4%, and 3%, respectively. Moreover, the Definitions-Plus group had significantly greater spelling gains (d = 0.57), and exhibited similar, albeit nonsignificant, trends on vocabulary gains (ds = 0.30 and 0.41 for receptive and definitional vocabulary, respectively). Results extend previous studies' results to younger English learner students on general benefits of novel word exposure in story contexts, and specific benefits for spelling and pronunciation practice in learning new words. Two appendixes provide supplemental tables on &quot;Target and Distractor Word Characteristics&quot; and &quot;Story Characteristics.&quot;",

				"dc:description" : "Post-problem reflective tutorial dialogues between human tutors and students are examined to predict when the tutor changed the level of abstraction from the student's preceding turn (i.e., used more general terms or more specific terms); such changes correlate with learning. Prior work examined lexical changes in abstraction. In this work, we consider semantic changes. Since we are interested in developing a fully-automatic computer-based tutor, we use only automatically-extractable features (e.g., percent of domain words in student turn) or features available in a tutoring system (e.g., correctness). We find patterns that predict tutor changes in abstraction better than a majority class baseline. Generalisation is best-predicted using student and reflection features. Specification is best-predicted using student and problem features.",

				"dc:description" : "The primary purpose of this study was to provide quantitative data on the use of released Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) exams as benchmark test instruments in a sample population. Teachers have expressed concern over &quot;teaching to the test,&quot; especially with the use of benchmark testing. This study was specifically undertaken to determine the extent of this practice, especially in light of published material from Texas Education Agency (TEA) that states this practice is not an appropriate use of the released instrument. An additional purpose was to gain quantitative data on the use of data harvested from both benchmark administrations of TAKS instruments and actual TAKS administrations in decision-making. Related literature was reviewed at length to trace the history of the testing movement and conduct a detailed examination of its current context. District level supervisors/coordinators of English language arts from the North Central Texas area were chosen as the sample population for a brief survey questioning the use of released TAKS exams and the subsequent use of data harvested from those benchmark assessments, as well as the use of actual TAKS scores. Survey questions were developed and tested for validity and reliability before being sent to the survey pool of 75 educators from districts in a target area having a combined student population of 625, 797 according to TEA enrollment reports. The response rate was 52%. The survey was administered via SurveyMonkey(TM), and data were gathered and analyzed using descriptive statistics to establish quantitative terms on the use of the practices, and also using inferential statistics through SPSS, specifically using chi square tests and a Fisher's Exact Test to determine if there was a relationship between school district composition and the use of these practices. The test also contained two open-ended questions allowing for more elaboration. The percentage of respondents who indicated that their districts used released TAKS tests as benchmark instruments was 68.3%, with 80.5% disaggregating the data from both these administrations and actual TAKS tests. That number rose to 98.6% when adding those who said they only disaggregated data occasionally. Only 1.0% of respondents said they never disaggregated TAKS data. However, not quite half (47.5%) said their districts always or frequently used TAKS data alone to make important decisions regarding student interventions. Slightly more than one-third (37.5%) indicated that the results of a benchmark exam had an impact on district instructional/curricular decisions. Over half (52%) indicated their districts used the released TAKS exams in full scale rehearsals that significantly interrupted the school day to prepare for actual administration. Additionally, the respondents expressed their main concerns for the transition from TAKS to STAAR. The implication is more districts are using multiple data sources to inform their data-driven applications, even though many districts utilize released TAKS exams as benchmark instruments. Further research is suggested regarding the assessment literacy of educators, particularly in relation to the use of a summative test for harvesting diagnostic data as Texas transitions to the new STAAR/EOC exams.

The information presented in this study involved virtual team members at the Defense Contract Management Agency, Navy Special Emphasis Operations. The aims of the study was to examine the influence of transformational leadership style as measured by Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (Bass &amp; Avolio, 2004) and employee satisfaction, as measured by the Spector's Job Satisfaction Survey (JSS) (Spector, 1997). The analyses utilized a Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient (two tailed) and a regression analyses was used to investigate the relationship between the two variables. The statistical analysis was conducted by using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 10.0 and in an Excel spreadsheet to foster congregate validity to the statistical findings. In each condition, the software programs were in agreement. Therefore, the survey data from the JSS revealed that virtual team members within the sample population experienced higher levels of employee satisfaction with virtual team leaders who adapt and use leadership style behaviors that lean more towards transformational leadership style behaviors than transactional leadership style behaviors. The survey data from the MLQ revealed that virtual team leaders within the sample population showed that employee job satisfaction and transformational leadership style as measured by the PPMCC had a statistically significant positive correlation.

				"dc:description" : "Education research continues to struggle with how to characterize students&apos; engagement in the doing of science. Too often, educators and researchers reduce doing science to learning particular facts and explanations, or participating in narrowly-defined, de-contextualized ways of reasoning and arguing. In this dissertation, I review prominent work that attempts to characterize students&apos; engagement in one aspect of doing science--seeking coherence. By seeking coherence, I mean trying to make information &quot;hang together&quot; in meaningful, mutually consistent ways. Using examples from a variety of science classrooms, I show that these prominent approaches fail to provide substantive accounts of students&apos; work to form connections between information. To address those weaknesses, I develop, refine and illustrate an alternative perspective on coherence seeking in science education, one that emphasizes what information students are trying to fit together, how they are trying to fit it together, and toward what ends.

				"dc:description" : "This study involved identifying, categorizing, and comparing critical incidents related to qualifying dual credit high school students' decisions to enroll or not to enroll in dual credit coursework in either a traditional or early college high school. The purpose of the study was: (a) to identify the reasons qualifying students decide to enroll in dual credit courses in a traditional or early college high school and (b) to identify the reasons qualifying students choose the traditional versus the early college high school. For this qualitative study, the research method employed was the Critical Incident Technique (CIT) developed by John Flanagan in 1954. The study, conducted in the fall of 2011, employed a written survey to obtain demographic information and the critical incident data. The study was conducted by appointed high school counselors at both high schools--traditional and early college. Both schools were located within the same school district. Total participants in the study totaled 139. The researcher, along with the help of a dual credit expert panel, identified, categorized, counted, and reported a total of 643 incidents--340 effective and 303 ineffective critical incidents. For both enrolled traditional and early college high school students, &quot;Incentives and Challenges&quot; was the most frequent reason students cited for enrolling in dual credit. Both types of students also indicated &quot;Culture/Atmosphere&quot; as the top reason they chose to attend one school versus the other. Not enrolled traditional high school students cited the &quot;Advanced Placement Course&quot; category as the top reason they chose not to enroll in dual credit. These students also cited &quot;Culture/Atmosphere&quot; as the main reason they chose the traditional versus the early college high school. Not enrolled early college high school students cited &quot;Personal Hindrances&quot; as the key reason for not enrolling in dual credit. This same category was also cited as the top reason that early college students gave for choosing the early college versus the traditional high school. Recommendations for further research are presented. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

				"dc:description" : "This study examined the academic preparation and job skill needs of information systems program graduates from institutions in an Eastern state, from their perspective. A historical review of the literature surrounding IS skill requirements was conducted for this study to provide the changes in IS over the past several decades. Providing a historical look at the literature will place into perspective the fact that the field changes rapidly, causing the need for the IS professional to also continuously change. The study employed a nonexperimental, qualitative research design to allow a descriptive interpretation of the views of recent IS graduates. Such an investigation provides insight into the effectiveness of undergraduate programs and identifies areas for collaboration and improvement in the development of IS graduates for the work force. The results of the study revealed that a consensus exists regarding the perceptions of the skills needed for the IS worker. However, graduates are concerned about how these skills are being delivered in order to develop competent IS professionals for the work force.

In an effort to bring writers&apos; voices to the forefront of these stories, this empirical study examines the types of questions and concerns writers have about writing as submitted through Purdue University&apos;s OWL Mail. This dissertation examines OWL Mail users&apos; inquiries submitted from 2006 to 2010 and identifies 60 different question types and the frequency with which they are asked. Demographic data by question type is also collected. This study categorizes users&apos; inquiries into the following top nine question types: Documentation Style, Grammar, Beyond the Scope of OWL Mail, Format, Genre, Punctuation, Word choice/form/usage, Unclear, and Resources. The final chapter describes the implications of these results and how they might shape our pedagogical and research practices in the writing center, online, and in the composition classroom. These implications will help to reshape the stories we tell about writers and their writing. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

The purpose of this qualitative, multisite narrative case study was to explore the perceptions, meanings, and interpretations of instructors and students. The theoretical foundation focused on the characteristics influencing adult student absenteeism and diminished engagement. Content analysis by interpretation was performed after conducting one-on-one interviews with 4 vocational instructors and 3 students. Data were then coded and categorized. Results indicated that teachers allow students to make up missed classes, but this repeated behavior does not adequately prepare the student for the workforce; students forgo inquiry for a counselor due to personal embarrassment and unknowingly dismiss available resources, students comprehension of materials due to learning at different pace and social awkwardness negatively impact outcomes, and students often find it difficult to cultivate relationships due to poorly developed interpersonal skills. These findings were used to create a modular professional development program for vocational school personnel and instructors. These modules provide a conduit for enabling social change by providing academic leaders reference materials that positively influence student outcomes in order to deliver the patient care required in today&apos;s ambulatory care settings across the United States.

				"dc:description" : "This qualitative case study examined first through fifth year principals and their perceptions of necessary job-related supports to successfully fulfill their professional role. The purpose of this study was to examine beginning principals&apos; experiences regarding leadership support they received during their first year in the principalship. This information was used to develop a principal mentoring program for a large suburban school district. The theoretical framework for this study was grounded in Burns&apos; theory on transformational leadership. Transformational leadership promotes an environment that encourages and supports school personnel and empowers others within the organization. The case study design employed multiple sources of data collection including a survey (Principal Induction Mentoring Survey) and a focus group interview with four novice principals. A qualitative content analysis was used to analyze all data. Categorical data were analyzed descriptively and interview data were coded for reoccurring themes and further analyzed through member checking. Key findings indicated that beginning principals perceive a benefit from being assigned a mentor during their first year in the principalship. School districts can provide beginning principals with job-embedded supports by developing effective mentoring programs that aid in transitioning to the role of the principal. This study contributes to social change by helping school districts recognize the importance of supporting beginning school principals. Potential benefits to school districts could include higher retention rates, reduction in cost of recruiting school leaders, and increased levels of job satisfaction.

				"dc:description" : "Today's public school principals lead under conditions of significant pressures for change. At the local level, principals are the primary receivers and interpreters of the discourses and demands for change coming from central administration. Principals must make sense of these discourses and demands for change at the local school level, and they must decide how they will respond to these demands in their own practice and in their work with teachers. The purpose of this interpretive case study was to examine the language of reform that the New York City Department of Education is using to shape the practices of principals and teachers at the local school level and to see how these demands are shaping what principals think and do as local school leaders. Data were collected over a period of two years using in-depth personal interviews with school principals, visiting school sites, and analyzing internal documents exchanged between the DOE and school principals. This study reveals that these principals struggle to make sense of the many demands placed on them by the DOE. They feel conflicted about spending too much time doing things that satisfy the DOE, but do not address the real needs of the students they serve. They must continually decide how they will use, modify, or reject the language and demands of the DOE, and they often feel torn between meeting those demands or doing the more important and satisfying aspects of their job. This problem is magnified by the fact that the NYC DOE relies almost entirely upon written communication to impose reform and assess change. Therefore, these principals spend large portions of each day managing DOE demands on-line and completing what they see as futile and often duplicative paperwork. As a result, all of these principals are deeply conflicted about continuing their work as school principals.

				"dc:description" : "Career and technical education (CTE) is faced with numerous forces that may impact its future. A variety of forces directly or indirectly affect CTE, ranging from the persisting stigma or negative image of career and technical education, the schools' curricular structure and requirements, along with federal laws such as No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and Perkins. Federal laws guide administrators' decisions at the local level that affect CTE. With NCLB goals for all students to improve academic achievement, reach high standards, and graduate from high school (HS), much pressure is placed on schools. NCLB emphasizes increased academic rigor and progress on students' state assessments, holding schools accountable to annual yearly improvement. With more accountability, more emphasis is being placed on core academics that may in turn reduce or eliminate elective career and technical education programs. With continued negative perceptions associated with career and technical education, reinforced by curricular tracks and coupled with the impact of NCLB, CTE is left in a precarious position. Some of these forces may have deleterious effects upon CTE depending upon decisions and reactions of local administrators. A quantitative survey research study was completed with Pennsylvania administrators from CTE schools and HSs. HS principals and CTE directors were surveyed as to how they perceived the effects of NCLB on role, image, and curriculum changes affecting career and technical education. Surveys were mailed to the directors of shared-time CTE schools and their respective sending HS principals. The results of the study revealed the perceptions of HS and CTE administrators concerning the ramifications of No Child Left Behind as it relates to CTEs image, the effects on curriculum, and CTEs role in helping schools meet the goals of NCLB. There were significant differences found between CTE directors and HS principals regarding their perceptions of the role and image of CTE as affected by NCLB. In addition, there were no significant differences found between administrators regarding their perceptions of curriculum changes affected by NCLB. Finally, there were no significant differences in perceptions found across settings or regions. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

				"dc:description" : "This dissertation study describes the nature of the mathematical knowledge required to teach a unit on exponents at the secondary school level, and further explores the adequacy of extant theoretical models for characterizing that knowledge. Researchers agree that teacher content knowledge contributes to teaching quality, which in turn contributes to student learning. Prior foundational research focused on the mathematical knowledge needed for teaching at the elementary level but not at the secondary level. Case study methodology was used with a constant comparative analytic process, modeled on similar successful methodologies used in investigating mathematical knowledge for elementary school teaching. The site was purposefully selected to maximize the opportunity to observe the use of mathematical knowledge in teaching. Data collected during the unit of instruction included lesson plans, video-recordings of all class sessions, and audio-recordings of daily follow-up interviews with the teacher. Results include a detailed description of the mathematical knowledge demanded in teaching a unit in secondary mathematics. The knowledge described in the results included substantial knowledge about the domain of mathematics and how it is practiced by mathematicians, especially in relation to definitions, definition extension, and proof. It also demanded that this knowledge be connected to specific content, exponents, in a way that allowed the teacher to see exponents as a case of a larger set of mathematical practices. This type of knowledge is not well described by existing frameworks for teacher knowledge, and the study&apos;s implications explore why and how existing theory might be adjusted to better account for such knowledge.

Research was conducted in one large urban elementary school. The unit of study was a third-grade RtI[superscript 2] team consisting of all four teachers, one instructional coach, and the principal. Data collection lasted six months and included interviews, observations, focus groups, and analysis of texts and artifacts. Results of this case study indicate that Tier 1/RtI[superscript 2] helps teachers conduct differentiated instruction, target, and monitor students&apos; academic performance to achieve/maintain Tier 1&apos;s objective of 80-85% student proficiency. However, more research is needed on specific ways Tier 1/RtI[superscript 2] impacts ELLs&apos; learning. The study demonstrates that instructional coaching fosters collaboration and encourages teachers to implement ELL strategies, analyze student data, and conduct focus planning during Tier1/RtI[superscript 2] .

				"dc:description" : "The purpose of this research was to describe the experiences of six women superintendents who began their careers as elementary principals. The central question was: What can we learn from the lived experience of women who came from a background as elementary educators and advanced to the superintendency in a variety of district contexts within Michigan's traditional public school system? The research design was a qualitative, interpretive, multiple case study approach using the data collection method of interviewing. Two conceptual frameworks--expectations states theory and feminist poststructuralism--provided the context for this research. Portraits of each of the six participants were shared to provide detailed descriptions. Four emergent themes common across all six participants were revealed. Those findings were: 1) All subjects got initiated to the idea of obtaining administrative positions through an external event and/or person of influence who instilled in them a belief about their potential as an administrator; 2) Most considered their elementary backgrounds as an advantage to their beliefs and strengths as a leader, which developed into understanding how the K-12 system works for students; 3) All participants raised the issue of the challenge of relating to secondary teachers--the steep learning curve around scheduling and staffing and also learning about a secondary climate and culture--as needed to be successful as superintendents coming from an elementary background; 4) In seeking or accepting a superintendency, there was a significant draw to a home district or region with family ties. In addition to these common themes, it was found that the timing of a woman's decision to apply for a superintendent position was dependent on certain variables lining up at the right moment. There was also a strong appreciation and desire for mentorship for women as they decide to enter administration and move along their career paths. Several recommendations resulted from the findings of this study, including ones for women aspirants to the superintendency, university preparation programs, and search firm consultants and school board members. These recommendations addressed the need to purposively study women's issues in leadership to further understand how women make decisions about their career paths.

For students with LD, challenges in written expression are more intensive than their typical peers. Without effective written expression supports and instruction, such as procedural facilitators, students with and without LD may be negatively impacted across academic areas and postschool outcomes. While research exists on procedural facilitators, little addresses how to sustain written expression gains after supports have been removed. Using a quasi-experimental design, secondary students with (n = 8) and without (n = 66) LD in written expression used a series of three procedural facilitators--from the most (i.e., prompts for the planning and organization process) to mid-way (i.e., brainstorming and topic sentence prompts) to the least support (i.e., brainstorming prompts). To begin this study, students completed a written expression pretest. Next, for each level of procedural facilitator, from the most to the least support, students wrote an essay with each. Last, students completed two posttests without the use of procedural facilitators two weeks and then four weeks later. All written expression prompts were for expository, five-paragraph essays, and preselected between the researchers and the teachers. Gains in written expression were analyzed with repeated measures, within factors ANOVAs with post-hoc analysis using students&apos; essays scores, derived from a rubric. Post-hoc analyses (i.e., Bonferroni) were used to understand if significant differences in written expression occurred between each level of graphic organizer. Results suggested that all students experienced significant gains in written expression when using the procedural facilitators. As the amount of support provided by the procedural facilitators was reduced, students continued to maintain their quality of written expression.

				"dc:description" : "This project study is an evaluation of a job-training program designed to serve unemployed adult learners at a community college. The program lacked empirical data about participants finding employment. The rationale for selecting the problem is the need to provide skill development and vocational training in response to high unemployment rates. The theoretical framework for the study was the logic model. The study was guided by research questions related to the inputs, the activities, and the intended outcomes of the job-training program. The research design was a qualitative program evaluation that employed case study methods. Data were collected using multiple sources, such as interviews, observations and program documents. Data analysis methods included classifying data with the logic model categories, describing thematic developments collected from the data, and examining formative and summative outcomes related to employment. The logic model was used to provide a framework for the evaluation and helped to analyze the program&apos;s activities (input, outputs, and outcomes) and findings. A key finding is that the program is effective at transitioning 95% of its participants from unemployed to employed status. The recommendation includes evaluating future cohorts to ensure continued program effectiveness. Implications for positive social change include the use of empirical data to improve and replicate a presumed effective job-training program that employs its participants thus contributing to personal success and development.

Conflict Boot Camp is a no-cost, court-mandated intervention program for high conflict parents and caretakers involved in a dependency court in the greater Los Angeles area. This program evaluation utilizes qualitative methods and triangulates findings from participant surveys, curriculum documents and interviews with judiciary professionals. Five overlapping themes emerged: interactions, empowerment through access to knowledge and strategies, children's needs, and direct application and behavior change. Perspectives from program participants and judicial professionals represented in this study provide valuable information for program quality and future research concerning court-based interventions for parents experiencing high levels of conflict.

				"dc:description" : "This study sought to conduct an assessment of a transfer retention program at a four year, commuter institution, and to examine its influence on the retention and academic performance of transfer students. A mixed methods case study utilizing both institutional quantitative data and qualitative interviews investigated the influence of this program on the success of the participating transfer students. Findings from the study showed that participating students performed academically better and persisted longer than students who did not participate in this program. Analysis of student interviews revealed that the retention program was designed in a manner that was cognizant of transfer student needs. Additional findings noted that students&apos; internal motivation to succeed, socio-economic status and family support also played a role in contributing to their success. This study reflects a connection with and also helps to advance current student development theories. Implications from this study can help similar institutions improve the success rates of their transfer students.

				"dc:description" : "At the postsecondary and secondary levels of education, students with learning disabilities are by law entitled to reasonable accommodation in support of their education. Secondary and postsecondary institutions as disability service providers are required to follow guidelines and direction to make this accommodation possible. Yet as these legislative actions continue to be upgraded and changed, students with learning disabilities are finding their lives increasingly impacted and their careers as well as their educational future in jeopardy (Eckes &amp; Ochoa, 2005). Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) contains federal laws that postsecondary disability service providers are mandated to follow. Public Law 94-142, known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), is the legislation covering disability service providers at the secondary schools. The enigma this presents for students with a disability is that once they attend a postsecondary school they are no longer eligible for IDEA, and come under Section 504 and the ADA. Although these federal laws have been passed to help protect students with disabilities from being discriminated against in both secondary and postsecondary schools (Wright &amp; Wright, 2007), interpretations of these laws are left up to the individual service provider. For the purpose of my research, postsecondary institution disability service providers were asked how prepared they were to accept students with learning disabilities, particularly those who have been diagnosed with a learning disability through the response to intervention (RTI) model or the summary of performance (SOP) model. The results concluded that disability service providers at the postsecondary level were not prepared to accommodate students with learning disabilities whose only documentation was that of a summary performance, which seemed to indicate that the IDEA legislation is not being upheld at the postsecondary level and that much additional education is necessary for service providers with respect to IDEA 2004, the reauthorization and the summary performance.

				"dc:description" : "Organizations are finding it difficult in today&apos;s economy to implement the vast information technology infrastructure required to effectively conduct their business operations. Despite the fact that some of these organizations are leveraging on the computational powers and the cost-saving benefits of computing on the Internet cloud, others still show reluctance in the implementation of cloud technology due to security and privacy concerns. This study examined factors that influence organizations in the adoption of cloud computing technology, integrating the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB). In the spring of 2012, this study conducted an online survey through Survey-Monkey. Data were collected from 105 respondents in information technology across many organizations in the United States of America. Multiple regression analysis was utilized to examine if there was a correlation between the five independent variable factors (attitude, subjective norm, behavioral control, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use) and one dependent factor (behavioral intent). The results showed a significant correlation of 70% variation between the factors and behavioral intent. Cloud adopters from the financial industry were found to exhibit a higher adoption rate than other industries analyzed. A total of 79 male and 26 female respondents participated. The age range of most participants was from 26 to 65. The findings of the study contribute to a theoretical foundation for future research and allow for better application of integrated Technology Acceptance Models.

				"dc:description" : "The primary purpose of this study was to validate a method for assessing Morphological Awareness (MA) using multimorphemic words commonly used in the academic and clinical practice settings of physical therapy. The Medical Morphology Test (MMT) was developed for this study and was compared to scores on the Nelson-Denny Reading Test (NDRT©). The NDRT© has previously been shown to be a predictor of both academic performance and performance on the National Physical Therapy Examination (NPTE). A secondary purpose of the study was to determine if the MMT could be used as a predictor of academic performance as measured by Grade Point Average (GPA) or to predict number of attempts to pass the NPTE. Pearson Correlations were used to compare scores on the NDRT© and MMT. Regression analysis was used to determine the predictive value of the MMT for academic performance and performance on the NPTE. Participants for this study consisted of 32 alumni of a single physical therapy program. Thirty of the participants completed both the NDRT© and MMT, two did not complete the NDRT©. Twenty-one of the participants had passed the NPTE© on the first attempt. Eleven of the subjects required between two and seven attempts to pass the NPTE. Results from this study found that there was a statistically significant relationship between scores on the MMT and NDRT©. Scores on the MMT were able to predict GPA and classify participants as members of a group who passed the NPTE on the first attempt or not, but scores on the MMT were not able to predict the actual number of attempts to pass the NPTE©.

				"dc:description" : "This dissertation contains three studies that investigate whether attested patterns of constituent order distribution and change in the world&apos;s languages can be attributed, in part, to cognitive preferences for some constituent orders over others. To assess these preferences, seven experiments employed an &quot;elicited pantomime&quot; task. Communication in gesture without speech may reveal cognitive pressures that otherwise remain hidden. Study 1 manipulates the whether the to-be-described events are semantically non-reversible (e.g. a woman lifting a box) or reversible (e.g. a woman lifting a boy). Across three experiments, participants reliably preferred SOV for describing non-reversible events in pantomime, but avoided using SOV to describe reversible events. Although previous accounts have assumed similar behavior to be due to constraints on comprehension, the distribution of alternative orders (mainly SVO, OSV, &amp; SOSV) suggests a greater role for constraints on production in explaining these patterns. Whereas Study 1 focuses on explaining drifts away from SOV, Study 2 tests the hypothesis that languages drift toward SVO because natural languages are subject to additional constraints that pantomime may not engage, such as pressures on information structure and efficiency. These additional pressures might work against OSV and SOSV, leaving SVO as a preferred solution for reversible events. Experiment 1 (English speakers) created more language-like conditions by simulating the emergence of a lexicon and of shared lexical knowledge. Under these conditions, OSV and SOSV decreased, and SVO increased. Experiment 2 found similar patterns with native speakers of an SOV language (Turkish), suggesting that the increase in SVO among English speakers was not simply a result of influence from their native language. Whereas Studies 1 and 2 focus on constituent order preferences in pantomime production, Study 3 focuses on pantomime comprehension. Speculation about constituent order preferences in comprehension has figured largely in linguistic and psycholinguistic theory, but little empirical evidence is currently available. Using a novel paradigm, Study 3 finds that constituent order preferences in comprehension are distinctly different from those in production, for both speakers of English (Experiment 1) and Turkish (Experiment 2). Results suggest that constraints on production may play a greater role than previously thought. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

				"dc:description" : "Online education is growing rapidly as colleges seek to increase enrollment without investing in physical infrastructure. To keep up with the increasing demand for courses, some colleges are asking faculty to teach classes online with little training, few resources, and minimal support. The purpose of this study was to determine how the training and support participants received affected the success of online courses they taught and to assess their satisfaction with the online experience. The theory of reasoned action provided the theoretical foundation for the study. Participants were asked to describe the types and the quality of training they received before teaching online, the resources and support available during their teaching, and whether the resources and support have led to or are leading to student success. A phenomenological research design was used to investigate deficiencies as well as strengths in educator preparation and training as they relate to satisfaction with teaching and preparation for the online environment. Data were collected using interviews and focus groups. Responses were coded and analyzed using the phenomenological approach with constructivist learning theories. Study results indicated that quality training prior to teaching online increases instructor confidence and readiness, ultimately resulting in a better experience for both teacher and student. Increasing the quality of online education could lead to positive social change in higher education by providing better, more effective instruction to students, particularly those whose geographic distances from physical classrooms have traditionally prevented their access to higher education.

				"dc:description" : "Researchers of leadership in management have explored why some managers excel in their positions and others fail. Some researchers have suggested that managers who use emotional intelligence while leading have a better opportunity to promote organizational success. Ineffective leadership may contribute to employees&apos; poor performance and lack of commitment to the organization&apos;s mission. This study used a quantitative survey design to evaluate the correlation between situational leadership styles and emotional intelligence in retail managers. Data were collected from 130 participants&apos; responses to two instruments: the Leadership Behavior Analysis II-Self and the Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test. The results indicated that more than half of the respondents were above normal on their flexibility scores and below normal on their effectiveness scores, which indicates that more leadership training is needed. Flexibility of leadership styles was negatively correlated with emotional intelligence and educational level was positively correlated to emotional intelligence. Exploring the relationship between situational leadership and emotional intelligence is a new endeavor in social sciences research. Implications for positive social change include leaders of retail organizations being able to understand how situational leadership styles and emotional intelligence work together to build leadership effectiveness. Managers will learn how to produce long-term results while improving their emotional intelligence skills. Furthermore, employee effectiveness can be increased through motivation and education, making a positive impact on retail organizations&apos; financial stability.

				"dc:description" : "This dissertation examines the lived experiences of white middle school teachers in predominantly white rural communities as they discuss race and race issues with students. Using methods of descriptive phenomenology, interviews were conducted with teachers to explore what it was like for them to talk about race in classrooms comprised of only white students, and when classes included one or two students of color. The essence of the experience was determined through phenomenological analysis, making meaning of how teachers&apos; experienced dialogue focused on race. Findings reveal six themes illuminating how teachers&apos; experienced talking about race and issues of race with students, whether the discussions were intentional or unplanned. Their experiences were characterized by fear and discomfort, uncertainty, anger, frustration, experience, and paralysis. Teachers experienced fear and discomfort as race became central to the discussion, especially concerned about how racial discourse would negatively impact the one or two students of color in the classroom. Uncertainty surfaced as teachers struggled with issues of colorblindness, &quot;politically correct&quot; language, and the possibility of reinforcing white supremacy. Anger and frustration emerged as teachers found they were unprepared and lacking experience in facilitating lessons and discussions surrounding race. However, experience acquired through exposure to aspects diversity in college, or years of integrating social justice issues into lessons, made teachers more likely to have discussions of race with students. Finally, as a result of the negative feelings they associated with discussions of race, some teachers experienced a sense of paralysis as they considered eliminating lessons in which issues of race might surface. This study contributes to an understanding of the experiences of white teachers as participants&apos; in a racial society within a predominantly white rural setting. Implications of the study suggest a need for teacher preparation programs to address race and racism more directly through curriculum and practice. This will significantly impact how white students and students of color make meaning of race in predominantly white communities.

				"dc:description" : "The concepts of workplace social interactions and team effectiveness have garnered a great deal of attention in organizational literature. However, these two concepts are seldom integrated for examination within the offshore technology groups. Drawing from the theory of workplace social exchange, this empirical study was initiated to investigate the relationship between team-member exchange (TMX) and perceived team effectiveness. Data was collected from a sample of 267 offshore IT professionals from the investment banking sector. Overall, results from correlational analyses conducted were consistent with the hypotheses. The results of the quantitative study indicated positive and significant correlations between the quality of TMX and offshore workers&apos; perceptions of team effectiveness. That is, greater peer exchange relationships are more likely to achieve higher levels of job satisfaction, job commitment, trust, job performance and cohesiveness. The findings have advanced the understanding of the importance of offshore coworkers&apos; interactions in relation to the overall team functioning. Practical and theoretical implications and future recommendations for research are presented. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

				"dc:description" : "In the first chapter, I measure the impact of student loan debt on young, college-educated workers&apos; decisions regarding labor supply and enrollment in graduate school. I exploit variation in student loan debt driven by the formulas that determine Federal Student Aid in order to identify these effects. Instrumental variable estimates indicate that in the initial years following graduation student loan debt seems to raise the likelihood of employment; the effect is most pronounced for female graduates. However, the evidence does not indicate that debt causes workers to opt into different types of occupations, as has been shown to be true among certain populations. Student loan debt also seems to lower the likelihood that an individual will obtain a graduate degree. These effects are too large to be consistent with the permanent income model, which predicts that graduates will effectively spread loan repayment over their lifetimes, causing only negligible changes in behavior during any single period. In the third chapter I examine lending mechanisms in the federal student loan program. Since the passage of the Higher Education Act in 1965, American students have been able to finance post-secondary education with federally subsidized loans. Until very recently students were able to access this credit through two channels; directly from the federal government or as a guaranteed loan from a private lender. The objective of this paper is to estimate the difference in loan default rates across the two lending programs. Since the programs serve distinct groups of students quasi-experimental estimation techniques are used to estimate this difference. The estimates suggest that the moral hazard created by the loan guarantee leads private lenders to generate higher rates of student loan default than direct lending. In the final chapter, I estimate the temporal pattern of earnings losses faced by displaced workers eligible for the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program. Data from the 2001 Survey of Income and Program Participation and is used to perform an event study analysis. The resulting evidence indicates that displaced workers face decrease earnings in the months prior to displacement, a large drop in earnings during the month of displacement and losses that persist up to 6 months after displacement. Displaced workers eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance face a similar pattern of earnings loss, but experience less loss during the period of displacement and greater losses during the period following displacement. Beyond the first month after displacement workers eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance do not experience losses in excess of other displaced workers. I also find that workers Eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance face higher rates of unemployment in the first three months following a displacement. By the fourth month the rate of unemployment is not different from other displaced workers. This evidence suggests that the additional benefits provided to unemployed workers under the Trade Adjustment Assistance program may not be warranted; these workers do not face persistent losses that exceed the losses experiences by other displaced workers.

				"dc:description" : "Demographic changes within the US are bringing significant changes in the cultural make-up of the classrooms in our schools. Results from national and state assessments indicate a growing achievement gap between the science scores of white students and students from minority communities. This gap indicates a disconnect somewhere in the science classrooms. This study examines the teacher's perspective of the changing learning environment. The study focuses on senior teachers with traditional Midwestern backgrounds and little multicultural experience assuming these teachers had little or no education in multicultural education. Senior teachers are also more likely to have completed their science education within a traditional Universalist perspective of science and likewise have little or no education in multicultural science. The research method was comparative case studies of a purposeful sample of nine science teachers within a community experiencing significant demographic change, seven core senior teachers and two frame of reference teachers. The interviews examined the teachers' awareness of their own cultural beliefs and the impact of those beliefs on classroom practices, the teachers' understanding of cultural influences on the students' academic performance, and the relationships between the teachers' understanding of the cultural aspects of the nature of science and their classroom practices. Analysis of the interview data revealed that the teachers maintain a strong, traditional Midwestern worldview for classroom expectations and they are generally unaware of the impact of those standards on the classroom environment. The teachers were supportive of minority students within their classroom, changing several practices to accommodate student needs, but they were unaware of the broader cultural influences on student learning. The teachers had a poor understanding of the nature of science and none of them recognized a cultural element of NOS. They maintained a Universalist perspective of science with a strong commitment to the philosophy of scientism which left no room for a multicultural view of science. These results have implications for the broad science community with respect to the philosophy and nature of science. There are also implications in pre-and in-service teacher education and professional development aimed at raising cultural awareness of science teachers and providing a broader understanding of NOS. The problems raised by this research appear to be systemic requiring a commitment beyond the level of the individual teacher to implement a multicultural education that matches the composition of our classrooms.

				"dc:description" : "Increasing Black and Latino college students&apos; engagement is a primary concern of critical educators who seek to advance their students&apos; critical literacy skills. There is a growing amount of these students who appear unable to successfully perform literate acts inside the academic space. However, these same students have rich literate lives outside of the classroom which forces the questions, where is the disconnect between the out-of-school literacy acts and those inside the classroom, and what happens when the border between in and out-of school is blurred, allowing students to bring their outside knowledge and practices into the classroom? This dissertation explores those questions by examining the experiences of three students and their instructor in a Freshman Composition classroom where popular culture is regularly incorporated into the curriculum in an attempt to engage students. The current theories have been insufficient in understanding the impact popular culture has on student literacy, as the focus has historically been on situating literacy practices within specific contexts, either out-of-school or inside the classroom. There is also not adequate understanding of Black and Latino students&apos; reactions to the incorporation of pop culture in academic spaces. Through an expansion of the theories of space, race, literacy and popular culture to create a lens I call critical spatial literacy, this study seeks to answer the following questions: 1) How do students&apos; experiences and understanding of space (in and out of school) shape their conception and practices of literacy? 2). How does the insertion of pop culture and other out-of-school knowledge/texts into the classroom space affect students&apos; academic engagement and/or resistance. Through ethnographic methods and Critical Discourse Analysis this work both documents and describes the students&apos; responses to lessons that challenged their concepts of appropriate textual use in an academic space, and the formal results of their literacy practices. In profiling the students&apos; creation of a third space (Bhabha, 1994; Moje et al, 2004) inside the classroom, this study seeks to expand the notions of space and composition, and to inform new pedagogies that utilize and respect the beliefs, experiences and practices of urban students.

				"dc:description" : "The Instant Word Notebook study was a program evaluation completed by two educators who saw a need for an instructional tool to teach and assess Instant Words. In order to address reading deficits of students in first and second grades, teachers were expected to teach Instant Words. Unfortunately, teachers did not have a systematic process to teach and assess Instant Words for mastery. The two educators of this study responded to the teachers' need for an instructional tool by creating The Instant Word Notebook. The Notebook was used by teachers to teach and assess Instant Words to first and second grade students with the anticipation of reading scores increasing. In order to measure the impact of The Instant Word Notebook on Instant Word recognition and reading achievement, the collaborative team completed a process and outcome evaluation of The Instant Word Notebook. In this outcome evaluation, the outcome investigator completed a Comparative Analysis of The Instant Word Notebook. Measurements utilized to determine the impact of The Instant Word Notebook were the scores from the Gates MacGinitie Reading pretests and posttests and the scores from the Instant Word Recognition pretests and posttests. Information from each test was utilized by the outcome investigator to identify the impact of The Instant Word Notebook on reading achievement and Instant Word recognition. This quantitative study focused especially on the mean difference between the treatment and control groups. The treatment group received six weeks of explicit instruction of Fry's 300 Instant Words. In contrast, the control group received the normal Instant Word instruction from their teachers. The outcome investigator compared the mean difference between the control and treatment groups to determine statistical significance of The Instant Word Notebook. The improvement in scores from the pretests to the posttests validated the use of The Instant Word Notebook as an instructional tool to improve sight word recognition.

				"dc:description" : "Prominent theorists assert that engaging in sociodramatic play is an essential activity for the development of self-regulation. This study proposed the use of sociodramatic play as an intervention tool for building self-regulation in kindergartners. In this study, two sociodramatic play intervention paradigms were compared to a control group. In the first play intervention, participants received environmental provisions (e.g., time, space, and materials) necessary for sociodramatic play. Participants second play intervention received the same provisions, and an adult co-player joined their play sessions to scaffold the development of advanced sociodramatic play skills. Three components of self-regulation were examined as outcomes, including attentional control, delay of gratification, and behavioral control. Using pretest and posttest design, a repeated-measures MANCOVA analysis was conducted. Results of the analysis revealed a significant positive effect of receiving a play intervention (regardless of the type) on behavioral regulation. Closer examination revealed that participants who received the environmental provisions intervention paradigm had a greater rate of improvement in behavioral regulation than the participants who received the adult-scaffolding intervention paradigm. Control group participants&apos; behavioral regulation decreased over time. This study also examined the role of gender and siblings. A repeated-measures MANCOVA revealed a significant main effect of Gender on the self-regulation variables. The effect of siblings was not significant. Gender played a notable role in the content of participant&apos;s play, which was distinct for each of the play paradigms. Males in the environmental provisions intervention groups engaged in more aggressive play themes than males in the adult-scaffolding intervention groups. The findings of this research suggest that the provision of time, space, and materials for sociodramatic play can positively influence behavioral regulation. Educators, counselors, and parents can make simple, inexpensive changes to open up opportunities for children to engage in sociodramatic play, which continues to have great potential as a medium for positively influencing the development of self-regulation.

				"dc:description" : "Many HIV prevention professionals have documented only moderate effectiveness of the Mpowerment Project, an HIV behavior intervention prevention program for minorities. Researchers have concluded that program success depends on effectiveness of peer leader management, yet little is known regarding the experiences of those peer leaders. Accordingly, this study explored experiences of peer leaders to determine factors of effectiveness in their work. This study was conducted within a framework of transformative learning to explore how personal transformation motivates, sustains, and extends within this context. Guiding questions explored motivation, traits, skills, and abilities peer leaders brought to the experience, activities they undertook to ensure success, comparison of actual experiences with expectations, and perceptions extended to future leaders. A series of private individual interviews with six program leaders chosen through purposeful sampling provided data for this qualitative case study. Transcribed interviews were open and axial coded, then analyzed through a constant comparative method. Key findings indicated that transformative learning is viable within this program context and that it is a useful tool for peer leaders in their efforts to modify behaviors of participants. Findings led to a training project that introduced leaders to transformative learning components as a tool for effective personal motivation and support. As a result, this project study created positive social change as findings and ongoing project implementation led to increased motivation and support of individuals working as peer leaders within the Mpowerment Project.

				"dc:description" : "Marginalized parents experience multiple and complex challenges in terms of social isolation, exclusion, and powerlessness. This empirical study investigated the effects of parent empowerment on academic outcomes using a large national representative sample and should provide insights about the importance of parent empowerment in education and counseling. Further, the study investigated the effect of the intersectionality of race/ethnicity, home language and income on parent empowerment. This first attempt at analyzing intersectionality in the context of parent empowerment may provide some guidance for future researchers in addressing the complex nature of intersecting identities. This study was a correlational study that used data from the Parent and Family Involvement Survey of the National Household Education Surveys (PFI-NHES: 2007) to investigate the relationship between parent empowerment and academic achievement as measured by parents' reports of students' grade point average (GPA). Using multiple linear regression and logistic regression, the findings of the current study demonstrated that some aspects of parent empowerment were related to children's academic achievement, namely, parents' competence, self-determination, community belonging, and community participation. Interestingly, parents' sense of meaning and consciousness were not related to children's academic achievement. Moreover, intersections of race/ethnicity, home language and income were also related to parent empowerment. The results are significant in that they provide empirical information for school counselors, teachers, administrators and counselors for working with parents. Furthermore, these data may begin to provide support for the conceptual framework of parent empowerment provided this study in order to guide future research and practice.

				"dc:description" : "The purpose of the qualitative phenomenological research study was to describe and explain the experiences of African Americans who terminated mental health treatment services after their initial sessions. The goal of the study was to expand the available knowledge by scientifically illuminating the lived experiences of African Americans who used mental health treatment services, which would enable clinicians and researchers to better understand how clients experienced using those services. The scientific phenomenological method developed by Giorgi (1997) was used as a framework from which to conduct in-depth interviews with 10 prospective participants whose experiences were audio-taped to capture the essence of their recollections in a specific point in time, in their own words. The data from participants were categorized into six themes, or constituents: (a) memories of pre-session traumas, (b) pre-session conditioning of attitudes and beliefs about therapy, (c) pre-session expectations of therapy, (d) initial in-session expectations, (e) decisions to terminate during the initial sessions, and (f) factors involved in the processes of termination. After closer analysis of the six themes, an enduring overall theme was identified that appeared to permeate the themes. A single eidetic structure discovered from the six constituents was the theme of &quot;fear,&quot; which was a prevailing theme in the description of the participants and presented itself in several forms.

				"dc:description" : "This study is a first year principal's quest to transform the culture of Midwest Middle School (MMS). The study covers the 2009-2010 school year. The data from the 2008-2009 school year provided the baseline data for this study. Alarming results of a state survey regarding the culture of the medium sized suburban middle school caused concern. The survey included responses from students, parents, and teachers specifically addressing building climate, safety, and efficacy. In four different categories, MMS finished in the first percentile response section. This translated to 99% of the students attending schools in the state responded more favorably to the select groups of questions than the students attending MMS. The survey results combined with the unremarkable academic achievement scores made it extremely clear that the school needed to change. The principal of MMS, who also served as the researcher for this study, set out to transform the culture of the school. The intention was to create a ripple effect that would benefit academic achievement, behavior, and climate in the building. The principal focused on data analysis and utilizing the data to inform instruction, implementing strict discipline consequences for inappropriate behavior while rewarding students exhibiting positive behavior and increasing opportunities to gain a greater sense of belonging. The researcher collected data over the course of the 2009-2010 school year. While the data showed little statistically significant differences in academic achievement, behavior, and building climate, the observable differences were remarkable.

				"dc:description" : "This project examines the intersectionalities of international females in engineering graduate programs of the United States, using frameworks of sustainability and liminality theory. According to Dutta and Kisselburgh (2011) international females in graduate engineering constitute the &quot;minorities of minorities,&quot; not only in terms of their status as international students but also by their underrepresentation as women in engineering (Faulkner, 2009). Research regarding international female graduate students tends to be categorized as the experiences of international students in the U.S. (Lee &amp; Rice, 2007), or as the struggles of female engineers in engineering disciplines (Tonso, 2007). Therefore, this project aims to distinguish the unique population of female engineers of international origin from holistic studies of international students, and attempts to draw out and understand the experiences of international female students in U.S. engineering graduate programs. Dutta and Kisselburgh (2011) found that female engineers who are international in origin exist in liminal states indefinitely. This liminal nature has been described under the theory of liminality (Turner, 1967) which posits that when transitioning from one life-changing event to another (such as birth, death, marriage), individuals go through a transformatory phase where they are subjected to invisibility, vulnerability, and a feeling of loss. Although Turner posited this phase as transcendental and temporary, Dutta and Kisselburgh (2011) suggest the liminal period can be more permanent in contemporary global societies. In other words, liminal experiences of vulnerability and structural invisibility may be sustained experiences of international female engineering students. Furthermore, the project attends to the overlaps, tensions and challenging experiences faced by international females in surviving engineering graduate program. To achieve this goal, liminality theory is limited in accounting for how vulnerable individuals reframe their agentic outcomes to make meaning of their marginalized existence. Therefore, I integrate constructs of sustainability with liminality theory in order to provide a framework to understand the ability of vulnerable individuals (in this case, international female engineers) to persist within marginalizing social structures. Sustainability has been a useful framework to understand how organizations practice self-efficacy (Butler, 2001) and has the potential to understand the negotiations and discursive practices enacted by international women engineers by examining their everyday meaning-making practices. For international female engineers who are in between spaces of belonging, it becomes important to understand how they navigate these contested spaces and how they transform the spaces to their advantage by persisting in their struggles with the spaces. Through interviews and focus groups, I explored the ways in which international female engineering graduate students negotiate the tensions they experience through interviews and focus groups, attending to the underlying processes of sustenance through which international female engineering students negotiate their liminal status. In doing so, I introduce and discuss five themes of the practice of sustainability in negotiating liminality: (a) crystallizing engineering identities, (b) (re)constructing inclusion, (c) enduring hardships, (d) rearchitecting (in)visibility, and (e) (re)engineering efficacy. The contributions of this research lie in the amalgamation of liminality and sustainability theories to understand the discourses through which international women engineering graduate students negotiate the transitions they experience in U.S. engineering programs.

				"dc:description" : "In an effort to increase writing scores and improve knowledge about historical events, a school district in the western region of the United States trained several teachers through the Document Based Question (DBQ) program. The rationale for this study was to explore the perceptions of elementary teachers who participated in this training in order to plan a writing project joining social studies and writing needs at an elementary school. The frameworks utilized in this study to interpret data and plan the project were Vygotsky's theory of the zone of proximal development, joined with its more concrete theoretical application of the theory to the classroom, Wood, Bruner, and Ross's theory of scaffolding. Additionally, Bandura's theory of self-efficacy was used to gauge how participants perceived their role in the act of teaching. The questions that guided the study focused on teachers' perceptions regarding (a) joining the teaching of writing and history, (b) professional development, and (c) their students' sense of self-efficacy. This project study used a case study research design with the qualitative data from interviews of four teachers and their documentary material to substantiate its findings. Data were examined through coding that established common themes among the participants. Results revealed a lack of background information, missing global connections, and a need for meaningful professional development. The intended outcome of the study was a project focusing on the heritage of individual students that would allow them to study, learn, and educate their fellow peers about global diversity and diverse cultures as a way to implement social change for the individual student and community at large.

				"dc:description" : "Engaging students in classroom discourse offers opportunities for students to participate in the construction of joint understandings, to negotiate relationships between different types of evidence, and to practice making evidence-based claims about science content. However, close attention to social aspects of learning is critical to creating inquiry-oriented classroom environments in which students learn with understanding. This study examined the social influences that contribute to classroom learning in an inquiry-oriented undergraduate physical chemistry class using the Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) approach. A qualitative approach to analyzing classroom discourse derived from Toulmin&apos;s (1968) model of argumentation was used to document patterns in classroom reasoning that reflect normative aspects of social interaction. Adapting the constructs of social and sociomathematical norms from the work of Yackel and Cobb (1996), I describe social aspects of the classroom environment by discussing normative aspects of social interaction (social norms) and discipline-specific criteria related to reasoning and justification in chemistry contexts, referred to here as sociochemical norms. This work discusses four social norms and two sociochemical norms that were documented over a five-week period of observation in Dr. Black&apos;s POGIL physical chemistry class. In small group activities, the socially established expectations that students explain reasoning, negotiate understandings of terminology and symbolic representations, and arrive at a consensus on critical thinking questions shaped small group interactions and reasoning. In whole class discussion, there was an expectation that students share reasoning with the class, and that the instructor provide feedback on student reasoning in ways that extended student contributions and elaborated relationships between macroscopic, particulate, and symbolic-level ideas. The ways in which the class constructed evidence-based claims about chemistry content reflected the influence of sociochemical norms that were enacted through classroom discourse. Two sociochemical norms were documented in both whole class and small group activities: first, the class used particulate-level evidence to make claims about chemical and physical properties; second, particular ways of using mathematical reasoning to justify claims about thermodynamics content became normative for the class. These similarities and differences between social and sociochemical norms in small group and whole class discussion highlight ways in which instructor facilitation can support productive interactions in classroom activities.

				"dc:description" : "The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not decreased articulation of speech played a role in the ability of an individual with Down syndrome or Fragile X syndrome to signal noncomprehension and whether the two groups differed in their levels of articulation of speech and noncomprehension signaling ability. The research was conducted using a group comparison design with two independent groups. The independent variable was the diagnosis of either Down syndrome or Fragile X syndrome, and the dependent variables were articulation of speech and noncomprehension signaling ability. The study was conducted in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, with 36 male participants, 18 each with Down syndrome and Fragile X syndrome. A screening assessment confirmed that the participants could hear within normal limits and that they were able to sit and attend, and follow simple directives. Performance on a receptive and expressive language assessment indicated that the groups did not differ significantly in their vocabulary and language abilities. The dependent variables of primary interest included number of errors on an articulation test, given to determine quality of speech for each participant, and number of noncomprehension signals on a noncomprehension signaling task, which was administered to determine if the participants could ask for clarification when unclear directions were presented to them. Results indicated that there was a significant relationship between articulation of speech, as measured by articulation errors, and noncomprehension signaling for both groups combined and for the DS group, but not for the FXS group. Results also indicated that, although articulation of speech was not significantly different in males with DS and FXS, males with DS were more likely to noncomprehension signal than males with FXS.

The participants were a kindergarten, first grade, and second grade teacher from a small school district in Indiana. Data was collected from observations and interviews. The data was analyzed through reconstructive data analysis (Carspecken, 1996) and semiotic analysis (Shank, 1994, &amp; 1998). Major findings include: (1) teachers' life experiences have contributed to the way teachers think about themselves, their teaching and their students, (2) Teachers' life experiences during their adult life challenged teachers' teaching, (3) Not all the participants expressed an awareness of the connection between life experiences and their teaching, (4) Teachers in this study established a separation between their personal and professional lives, (5) Teachers seem to have limited awareness of the interconnectedness of who they are and who the other (students, parents etc.) is culturally, (6) Teachers attribute students' achievement to students' family background and perceived parent's values on education. In the case of Latino/a immigrant students, teachers claim that it is not being Latino/a or immigrant that impacts their learning but having a known learning disability, lack of knowledge of English language and home background.

Analysis of the data resulted in the development of five themes for improvements in the event of future emergencies: (a) prepare for more complete and effective communication during and following an emergency; (b) provide for additional safety training in general; (c) account for every child prior to releasing students to anyone; (d) avoid use of back two rows on any buses; and (e) allow students to be able to use cell phones. Conclusions of the study included the following: Nearly 100% of the respondents felt a high degree of confidence in the district; however, they did have recommendations on ways to improve the district's response to emergencies. Recommendations included developing a parent advisory team to assist with communication during crises; providing parent advisory team training for emergency preparation; providing further training for students in several areas of concern; using the parent advisory team to assist with accounting for every child during and following emergencies; ensuring that every building has a backup paper copy of demographic information on all children; eliminating the use of the two back seats on school buses; and re-examining the school district policy on cell phone use. Recommendations for future research include researching the lessons the Joplin School District learned after its massive tornado of May, 2011; investigating other school districts that have instituted a parent advisory team to assist with emergencies; and developing an updated safety guide with greater detail than the current safety guide.

				"dc:description" : "An economy struggling to rise out of recession presents a difficult time for institutions of higher education as state and federal support for higher education is not keeping pace with costs (Newman, Couturier, &amp; Scurry, 2004; Wellman, Desrochers, &amp; Lenihan, 2009). It is essential for colleges and universities to raise funds from external sources, particularly alumni, which have continued to wane in recent years. More specifically, institutions should focus on the cultivation of young alumni donors to maximize long-term fundraising efforts (Engagement Strategies Group [ESG], 2010; Hurvitz, 2010; Mann, 2007; Meer, 2010; Monks, 2003). McMillan and Chavis' (1986) &quot;sense of community&quot; theory, which highlights membership; influence; integration and fulfillment of needs; and shared emotional connection, was used as a framework to explore the following research question: What strategies do institutions with high young alumni participation rates employ to promote young alumni giving? Using a qualitative descriptive design, semi-structured interviews (N = 16) were conducted at institutions (N = 4) falling under the same Carnegie classification of Arts &amp; Sciences focus/no graduate co-existence in the northeast. The chief advancement officer, the chief alumni relations officer, the assistant director of young alumni giving, and a young alumnus/a peer agent were interviewed to gather data in a four-strata approach. Data were coded and analyzed using Rubin &amp; Rubin's (2005) interpretive framework. Finally, document analyses of websites, Facebook pages, and campaign letters provided rich content to triangulate the data obtained from the interviews. Five key findings emerged, including: foster a sense of community; treat young alumni as partners; institute philanthropy education; gain feedback; and draw upon emotional connections. Leaders in higher education may benefit from these strategies, which can be used to cultivate young alumni donors, and they may adopt and implement these tactics at their own institutions. Colleges and universities with high young alumni participation rates will benefit from long-term fiscal sustainability (ESG, 2010), and with increased funds, will be more likely to meet their strategic goals (Mann, 2007). Future generations of college students will also benefit because the burden that students acquire due to rising tuition costs may be alleviated through the generosity of alumni.

				"dc:description" : "This study focuses on the issue of learning equity in colleges and universities where teaching and learning have come to depend heavily on computer technologies. The study uses the Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) latent variable model to quantitatively investigate whether there is a gender /ethnicity difference in using computer based course management system (CMS) for course tasks. The study further investigates whether there is an association between course management system use and academic achievement. The MIMIC model has many advantages for the current data analysis, including an allowance for simultaneous examination of multiple group differences in a latent factor framework. In this study, data from over 993 students who enrolled in the three courses, Anthropology 201, Biology 206, and Chemistry 116, at a Midwest public university were collected in the spring of 2010. These three courses were selected because the instructors and students actively utilized a course management system for their teaching and learning activities. Data preparation involved the removal of extraneous records and transformation of the original data in order to satisfy the assumption of MIMIC model. The model building procedure began by checking the validity of the measurement model without covariates, followed by incorporating covariate variables--gender (males versus females) and ethnicity (African Americans, Asian Americans, Caucasians, Hispanic Americans)--into the fitted measurement model. A final model with the best model fit was selected for testing group invariance. Results from the final model revealed that: (a) group invariance was present for gender and ethnic groups in use of the course management system. Male students had a significantly higher mean on their frequency of using the course management system than female students. Asian students had the significantly highest mean among all the ethnic groups. Additionally, (b) the amount of involvement in the course management system had positive association with student's academic outcome. When student's scholastic aptitude was controlled, Asian students who used the course management system the most frequently tended to have the highest academic outcome. These findings may imply that &quot;digital divide&quot; experienced in childhood might continue to impact course management system use in college to some extent; also, the quantity use of course management system was critical to student academic outcome, but quantity alone could not guarantee a dramatic improvement of academic achievement. The quality of course management system use needs to be defined. The study has significant implications for policy and practice. Specifically, the study discusses in detail practical methods for eliminating academic discrepancies, which may be due to different uses of course management system. Finally, the study points to new directions for research into course management system use in higher education.

Though the case was fought with good intentions, there may have been unintended consequences that occurred due to the policy implementation. The purpose of this research was to explore the policy, its implementation, and assess the extent to which the goals of the original policy were met. This study used a mixed-methods approach and was set within one large urban school district. The qualitative portion of the study included interviews with a small group of educators who were directly impacted by &quot;Brown&quot; and its implementation. The data from both the interviews and the selected focus schools indicated that the initial goals of &quot;Brown,&quot; equal educational opportunities and integrated schooling, were not met. This research provided information from key areas that may serve as a guide to help make future policy implementation successful.

				"dc:description" : "This investigation used mixed methods to establish evidence about graduate faculty members&apos; ideas about underprepared writers in graduate school. The research question focused on what faculty think should be done about students who make it through their school&apos;s admissions process, but lack the skills necessary for the academic writing tasks associated with their degree requirements. The research method included a quantitative phase in which graduate faculty members responded to a Likert-style survey (n = 143) and a qualitative phase in which graduate faculty members participated in 30-minute interviews (n = 12). Data from the two phases were analyzed separately, followed by a third round of analysis that focused on the overlap of the two. The results indicated that graduate faculty members encounter underprepared writers often, and they believe writing to be very important in graduate school. Little consensus existed in the sample (from both phases) on whether the graduate faculty member is primarily responsible for remediating the underprepared writer or if the institution has a responsibility to offer remediation or support services. Participants favored writing assessment at the beginning of graduate study, a required writing course at the early stages of coursework, and stronger pedagogy, including scaffolding, lower stakes assignments, and the use of writing as a tool of intellectual inquiry.

				"dc:description" : "One of the most pronounced trends in higher education over the last decade has been the increased reliance on instructors outside of the traditional full-time, Ph.D.-trained model. Nearly 43 percent of all teaching faculty were part-time in 1998, and at selective colleges, graduate assistant instructors teach over 35 percent of introductory courses. Critics argue that these alternative instructors, with less education and engagement within a university, are causing the quality of education to deteriorate and may affect student interest in a subject. However, little research exists to document these claims. This paper attempts to fill this void using a unique dataset of students at public, four-year colleges in Ohio. The paper quantifies how adjunct and graduate assistant instructors affect the likelihood of enrollment and success in subsequent courses. Because students with alternative instructors may differ systematically from other students, the paper uses two empirical strategies: course fixed effects and a value-added instructor model. The results suggest that adjunct and graduate assistant instructors generally reduce subsequent interest in a subject relative to full-time faculty members, but the effects are small and differ by discipline. Adjuncts and graduate assistants negatively affect students in the humanities while positively affecting students in some of the technical and professional fields.",

				"dc:description" : "Education has continued to follow a traditional teaching model which may not prepare students with needed workforce skills. Social networking has been viewed as a technology tool useful for enhancing communication at both the business and educational level. The theory of connectivism underscores the need for social group interaction to provide meaning. The research questions for this quantitative study involved exploration of the potential connection between social networking and increased literacy skills. 32 public school teachers of one school district provided survey information that included the amount of social networking students used in the classroom. Regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between social networking time per teacher, teacher age, years of experience teaching, and their students' state mandated reading test scores. Increased time on social networking assignments and teacher experience predicted reading test scores. Results suggest that social networking in school is a worthwhile endeavor to bring relevance to students and increase their literacy skills. One implication for positive social change is shifting the national educational pedagogy to include additional technology training for students. A second implication for positive social change is using the results to improve students' technology and literacy skills to help them compete successfully in a global economy.

				"dc:description" : "This phenomenological study of the lived experience of leadership emergence was initiated to answer the question, &quot;Where does leadership come from?&quot; Leadership emergence was explored as the result of a nexus of contextual and structural influences. In response to these questions, a sample of leaders from a metropolitan area in a Southwestern state were interviewed using an opened-ended, qualitative process. The interview data were reviewed and analyzed via the Moustakas modified van Kaam method of transcendental phenomenological analysis. The findings of the study supported a number of independent theoretical aspects as factors of leadership emergence and revealed that leadership emergence is fundamental to the presence of four essences that represent the origins of leadership in the sample. These essences presented themselves as phenomena in the data and were classified as deontology, belief systems, patterns, and personal knowledge. In application, these essences represented two parallel or helix timelines of the pre-factors of leadership creation. In representation of these pre-leadership essences, models depicting linear pre-leadership development were developed from the findings, and kinetic leader motivations, personal drivers and external influences creating a nexus of factors for leadership development were illustrated from the study's finding. The study added to the body of knowledge in its unique application of the modified van Kaam methodology to an emerging leadership study and in identification of the potential roots of leadership.

				"dc:description" : "Companies constantly adapt to new business environments in order to be successful and stay relevant. Innovation is a vital source for a company to be competitive in the business environment. Innovations enable companies to develop and utilize new strategies, tools, and tactics as well as new products and services. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are comprehensive software packages that aim to integrate business processes and functions. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of ERP systems on the innovative capabilities of the organization, using quantitative research methods with an exploratory research design. The design of the study involved determining the influential factors to innovation in terms of ERP systems and analyzing the secondary data of two surveys on innovation and information technologies relationship. The data were collected as a part of a longitudinal, multinational research effort in manufacturing and retail, transportation, and logistics sectors. The research suggests a theoretical framework on ERP innovation relationship and presents empirical findings.

State governing bodies supply broad guidelines and are the only measuring tool given to these institutions to assess the effectiveness of their committees. Organizational models found in the literature do not include state guidelines and are therefore inadequate to measure the effectiveness of workforce advisory committees adequately. This qualitative case study involved an examination of workforce advisory committees in the Lone Star College System by interviewing community workforce advisory members and accessing workforce advisory committee meeting minutes. Workforce advisory committee members answered research questions detailing how institutions of higher learning measured the effectiveness of workforce advisory committees given the outputs of effectiveness by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board and how institutions of higher learning measure the effectiveness of workforce advisory committees given the outputs of effectiveness in Genheimer's model. The study included both qualitative and quantitative data from semistructured interviews with advisory committee members. Community workforce advisory committee members shared their thoughts on certain aspects of member selection, input criteria that contributed to Genheimer's effectiveness outputs of effectiveness, and state-supplied outputs of effectiveness.

				"dc:description" : "For some time, it has been clear that students who are tutored generally learn more than students who experience classroom instruction (e.g., Bloom, 1984). Much research has been devoted to identifying features of tutorial dialogue that can explain its effectiveness, so that these features can be simulated in natural-language tutoring systems. One hypothesis is that the highly interactive nature of tutoring itself promotes learning--that is, the &quot;interaction hypothesis.&quot; Although reasonable and agreeing with much research, the interaction hypothesis raises the question of what linguistic mechanisms are involved: that is, which features of &quot;highly interactive&quot; dialogues trigger what processes that are conducive to learning? Our overall strategy in the research described in this article was to inform this question by identifying co-constructed discourse relations in tutorial dialogues whose frequency of occurrence predicts learning, identify the context in which these relations occur, and use this knowledge to formulate decision rules to guide automated dialogues. We used Rhetorical Structure Theory to identify and tag co-constructed discourse relations in a large corpus of physics tutoring dialogues. Our analyses suggest that the effectiveness of human tutoring might well lie in the language of tutoring itself. Moreover, the types of co-constructed discourse relations that predict learning seem to vary based on students' ability level. We describe Rimac, a natural-language tutoring system that implements an initial set of decision rules based on these analyses. These rules guide reflective dialogues about the concepts associated with physics problems. Rimac is being pilot tested in high school physics classes.",

				"dc:description" : "This research study reviewed relative literature on information security and information security culture within organizations to determine what factors potentially assist an organization in implementing, integrating, and maintaining a successful organizational information security culture. Based on this review of literature, five key factors were determined to potentially contribute to a successful information security culture. A survey instrument was designed to determine if each of the key factors had a significant association with a successful organizational information security culture, if the factors had a positive or negative relationship with a successful information security culture, and the strength of the relationship to a successful organizational security culture. The data from 200 useable surveys were analyzed using the Chi Square Test of Independence and Bivariate/Pearson&apos;s correlation to determine the relation between each of the key factors, the independent variables, and the dependent variable, defined as a successful organizational information security culture. The analysis of this data is presented for both scholarly and practitioner information and use. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

				"dc:description" : "The purpose of this study was to assess differences in trends between 13 special education diagnostic eligibility categories over time in California. A secondary purpose was to determine whether differences occur among county types (rural, urban, or other) or between regions (Northern or Southern California). Analysis of descriptive statistics revealed that changes have occurred over time within the 13 eligibility categories between the years 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010. Thirteen repeated measure ANOVAs were performed, one for each eligibility category, with the dependent variable being percentage and the independent variable year. Results indicated that the SLD category demonstrated a significant decrease between 2002 and 2010. Categories with significant increases between 2002 and 2010 included OHI, AUT, ED, HOH and DB. Categories which did not demonstrate significant changes included SLI, ID, DEAF, VI, OI, MD and TBI. To determine whether significant changes occurred between Northern and Southern California regions, 5 Profile Analyses were performed, 1 for each year studied. The results indicated no significant differences between Northern and Southern California. A second set of profile analyses were run, 1 for each year, to determine whether there were significant differences between rural, urban, and other county types. The results indicated that for each year, there were significant differences between county types, with lowest percentages of SLD occurring in urban counties. SLI and OHI were highest in urban counties. The category of AUT was highest in rural county types. Practical and scientific significance of these eligibility changes was discussed.

				"dc:description" : "In secondary science, the 2011 Teacher Performance Assessment (TPA) was designed to represent a teacher candidate&apos;s ability to both apply their understanding of their science content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge, and to allow the candidates to reflect on student learning. Specifically, Task 2 of the TPA requires teacher candidates to observe their students in action, and to reflect upon both the levels and types of student engagement present in their video. Inquiry-based instruction is a key component of educational reform in science. While scientific inquiry may be difficult for teacher candidates, this video-based commentary provides the opportunity for them to focus on developing an inquiry-based learning environment in their classroom. During the pilot year of the TPA, findings in this study revealed that teacher candidates&apos; scores on the TPA were directly related to their ability to hear, understand, and evaluate the content of student conversations. Most candidates had appropriate views of inquiry-based instruction, and revealed strong reflective practice in both their written commentary and their reflective journal postings. However, the teacher candidates struggled to implement inquiry in meaningful ways, and to capture good evidence of inquiry-based instruction and student engagement for the TPA Task 2. Cross case analysis considered six teacher candidates&apos; TPA scores, reflective journal postings, and semi-structured interviews. Four of the six candidates who were interviewed passed the TPA Task 2, and revealed rich descriptions of inquiry in their commentary, reflective journals and interviews, including all five essential features of inquiry. The two low-scoring candidates, however, had vague descriptions of inquiry, and left out one or more essential feature of inquiry. Additionally, one candidate maintained misunderstandings in their interview. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

The purpose of this research is to conceptualize these kinds of technology-based learning projects (TBLPs) through a sociocultural perspective. The methodology included focus group discussions and field notes to collect empirical data. The findings reveal that the more educational technologies capture objects of learning positioned in the students' sociocultural proximity, the more focused learners' attention are on these objects. The study shows also that a change in learning projects may depend to a large extent on whether the technology relates to the students' sociocultural proximity, i.e. taking into consideration students' physical, cultural and contextual real world. The study recommends a community of learning/inquiry embedded in a collaborative, problem-solving dynamic involving cognitive support from peers, teachers, external specialists and the wider community.",

				"dc:description" : "According to R. Wayne (&quot;Legal Guidelines for Dismissing Students Because of Poor Performance in the Field,&quot; 2004), there is a widely accepted assumption in social work education that field placement provides the best opportunity to evaluate students&apos; goodness-of-fit with the profession and is therefore used to weed out unsuitable students. This study examined factors that result in premature termination of bachelor of social work (BSW) students&apos; field placements. The study was quantitative, non-experimental, correlational research. The study instrument was a self-administered web-based survey that was sent to respondents via e-mail. The relationship between variables that contribute to premature termination of field placement for BSW students was investigated. The findings indicate that termination-from-field placement policy is considered important and the policy is communicated to departmental faculty, social work students and field placement agencies/organizations. The study also revealed the students who have experienced premature termination/disruption from field placement are reinstated into field placement the majority of the time.

				"dc:description" : "Schools and school districts are faced with a shortage or pending shortage of school principals and individuals desiring to be a school principal. Building leadership capacity, especially for the role of school principal, must become a priority for school and district leaders (Fleener et al., 2009; Louisiana Department of Education, 2011; Rhodes &amp; Brundrett, 2009; Schmidt-Davis &amp; Bottoms, 2011). A review of the literature addressing possible ways to build leadership capacity included succession planning, leadership development, and leadership efficacy. This study investigated the relationship between administrators' involvement in leadership development and their self-efficacy for school leadership. A survey, composed of two instruments, was used to collect information from administrators of a large school district in Southeast Louisiana. The response rate was high at 74%, with 95 of 129 administrators responding. Respondents answered five-point Likert scales on the first instrument which measured leadership development experiences, value placed on these experiences, and attitudes toward these experiences. Computation of item means indicated that respondents had some participation in pre-administrator leadership development and felt that the activities or experiences were important in developing them as leaders. Respondents held a somewhat favorable attitude toward the activities. The second part of the survey, also a five-point Likert scale and an adaptation of the Principal Sense of Efficacy Scale (Tschannen-Moran &amp; Gareis, 2004), addressed administrators' levels of self-efficacy toward administrative tasks. Respondents, on average, held a somewhat strong self-efficacy toward the tasks. Calculations of the relationship between leadership development and administrator self-efficacy revealed a statistically significant relationship. That is, the more administrators were involved in leadership development, the higher their levels of leadership self-efficacy.

				"dc:description" : "Journalism educators must make critical decisions about their undergraduate curricula, determining how to best prepare their students for professional careers. Present scholarship indicates that a disconnect exists in what journalism students think they ought to know and/or be able to do upon graduation, what educators think they must teach their students, and what current practitioners identify and value in entry-level journalists. This case study addresses a void in scholarship, as it explores what constitutes adequate preparation in a local context: via perceptions of journalism students and educators at the University of Utah as well as journalism practitioners who work in the Salt Lake Valley. Multiple methods--focused interviews, descriptive surveys, and direct observations--illuminated students', educators', and practitioners' perceptions of preparation and revealed, contrary to other researchers' findings, overall agreement among these three communities. Entry-level journalists, according to the data, must have stellar reporting and writing skills, exercise critical-thinking skills, remain curious about the world around them, understand basic governmental processes and protocols, and practice their craft--on their own and in professional opportunities as they emerge. Eight specific suggestions resulted from the data that may improve the existing undergraduate journalism curriculum at the University of Utah.

				"dc:description" : "This study examined the effects of exposure to international students on American student and faculty perceptions at a regional Appalachian University. A revised and improved version of Jaleh Shabahang's (1993) &quot;International Education Opinionnaire&quot; was used to survey American students and faculty regarding their perceptions of the educational and cultural impact of international students. The revised instrument also measured American student and faculty perceptions of five ethnic groups of international students. Three independent samples t-tests were administered to compare the views between two American groups: students or faculty in international-related academic departments (IRs) and non-international-related academic departments (NIRs). The first test examined the average difference in perceived educational impact of international students. The second test examined the difference in perceived cultural impact of international students. The third test examined the relative standing of five ethnic groups of international students between White, Non-Hispanic and Non-White participants. Data analysis revealed that there were no significant differences between American students or faculty from IRs and NIRs on the first and second tests. The data analysis also revealed no significant differences between White, Non-Hispanic and Non-White American students or faculty regarding their attitudes toward the five ethnic groups of international students. American students and faculty from both kinds of academic departments at the Appalachian University mostly agreed or strongly agreed on the positive educational and cultural contributions of international students. In terms of perceptions, the third independent samples t-test showed that Middle Eastern and Hispanic students ranked the lowest.

As educational institutions continue to face budgetary uncertainties, academic advising services are facing cuts that threaten their ability to provide student support. Online solutions are being advanced at many institutions, as they offer potential amplification of dwindling resources. Although online education has been heavily researched, online academic advising is not as well studied. This study sought to understand the core components of academic advising and applied these findings to the creation of an online academic advising website, a virtual intelligent counselor (VIC). VIC was then used to probe student perceptions of online academic advising. A mixed-methods multiphase research design, using both a pre-validated survey instrument and student interviews, permitted comparison of student perceptions of this academic advising website to perceptions of an actual advising system at a local area community college. Student perceptions of the website demonstrated support for peer-generated educational roadmaps and other design elements incorporated into VIC. Additionally, the usefulness and potential of this website as a planning tool was seen in student interviews. Online tools hold the promise of delivering advising services in financially difficult times, and the importance of proper design has been shown to be a key to unlocking this great challenge.

				"dc:description" : "Public school education and reform face a myriad of challenges that are uniquely different from those of years past. Tougher curriculum standards, societal differences, cultural diversity and an overall shift in educational attitudes and practices may limit and change the educational success of many children. The cognitive development of students and knowledge base of students entering school is coherently critical to the success of not only the child, but the school and school system as well. Because of this, high stakes are now placed upon a school's performance. With the unyielding pressure to excel on standardized tests, schools often find it critical for students to enter kindergarten ready to learn and having skills previously unheard of. This study took an in-depth look at the skills students should have prior to entering kindergarten as well as the informal education they receive from their home environment prior to entering formal education in a suburban north Georgia school district. The study collected and interpreted data, test scores, and parent surveys in order to decipher a correlation. Based on the results of the responses as indicated on the parent survey, there were not any specific home or preschool activities that significantly affected GKIDS scores. On the contrary, the age of the kindergarten student does significantly affect students' GKIDS scores. This study paved the way to creating and developing programs, literature, classes, and insight that will help future kindergarteners and their parents ensure kindergarten success.

				"dc:description" : "For nurses or physicians practicing in any healthcare setting today, nothing seems to be as unsettling then change associated with the introduction of new information technology. The need for information technology has created a new host of challenges that do not easily align to clinical practice. In this study, perceptions of usefulness, ease of use, relevance, complexity and self-efficacy were examined relative to understanding what creates intention to use information technology. Clinicians from three hospitals participated by completing a survey designed to target their perceptions of these constructs as related to the introduction of a policy and procedure software product as an example of new information technology designed to support clinical care. Using multiple regression methodology, relationships between individual constructs were explored and evaluated as predictors of intention to use information technology. The findings of this study indicate that Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Relevance are of paramount importance to both of these groups of knowledge based workers, but most particularly to physicians. Furthermore, the study findings indicate that Task Specific-Computer Self Efficacy builds with increased exposure to information technology. The results of this study support plausible application for immediate improvement in launching new information technology for nurses and physicians.

				"dc:description" : "This study traces the first year experiences of six international exchange teachers employed in three public and charter schools settings from three districts in two southeastern states. Interviews with these teachers from China, Germany and Colombia, and with their school and district leaders enabled me to produce a narrative of how international exchange teachers adapt to teaching in American schools. I adopted a cooperative stance as I observed and audio recorded their personal and professional lives at the beginning of the school year, then again shortly following the scheduled mid-year winter break, and for a third time before end-of-year state testing in the spring. I found that all of these international exchange teachers shared two struggles. First, there were challenges of adjusting to the lifestyle: to acknowledge that America is as diverse as it is homogeneous. Second, was the challenge of adjusting to the mores of American life---that of getting a state license to drive, buying a car, finding an insurance agent to provide vehicle coverage. Also find a place to live, access to water and electrical services, and secure household furnishings became an unexpected endeavor. The context of colleagueship was shown to fall within a short window of time. This was due to teachers arriving in the states after the school year had begun with little time to prepare rooms or gather classroom materials. When comparing the practices of the participants in their native countries to their American classroom practices mirror the current culture. Participants had unclear expectations of the program design, and procedural expectations. Central to that focus was management of student's behavior, lack of classroom resources and understanding parent participation and parent expectations. Common themes emerged, indicating these teachers all had a desire to work with students, a passion for teaching and expanded opportunities in their home countries that stem from their experiences teaching in the United States. Exemplary models of induction both in the U. S. and internationally should be sought in order to identify and disseminate best practices that would better accommodate international exchange teachers' transition into the teaching carousel.

				"dc:description" : "Federal and state mandates requiring accountability for the achievement of all students--including those with disabilities--coupled with tight budgetary restraints has led to the steady rise in the employment of paraprofessionals in P-12 educational settings. The emergence of the paraprofessional system has led to several challenges. While several states have delineated competencies in the standards they believe paraprofessionals should demonstrate, the problem exists in that it is unknown whether paraprofessionals possess these competencies. The purpose of the two-phased, sequential mixed method study was to explore the perceived competency of paraprofessionals in an educational district in a Midwestern state using their own voice. The first, quantitative phase addressed the significant difference in perceived competency based on years worked as a paraprofessional through data analysis of survey. The second, qualitative phase further investigated the survey results by interviewing several survey respondents to probe the significant quantitative results. Based on the data, there was a significant difference in competency based on years worked. Paraprofessionals with 6 or more years of service recognized and were competent in the professional nature of their work. Overall, they viewed themselves as somewhat competent in all nine core competencies, but believed their supervising teachers, special education directors, and administrators were not aware of the core competencies and their administrators were not aware of what paraprofessionals do each day. Not being viewed as a professional makes the job they perform less effective and results in school districts not investing needed resources in their training.

This was done by acknowledging distinctions and differences between junior high schools, the current middle school, and the new middle school, delineated by current middle school-reform research. This study explored issues regarding the policies, personnel, decision-making strategies, timelines, and organizational structures of the new middle school. The reconfiguration resulted in rezoning attendance zones, reconstructing the new high school, raising the new elementary school, repurposing the old elementary school, reconfiguring the grades, and reassigning existing staff among the district&apos;s buildings. The students in the 4 middle schools, the junior high school, and the new high and elementary schools were reassigned. The district established a 2012 planning committee to inform decision making. Influences affecting perceptions were found in three primary trends: (a) communication, (b) leadership, and (c) the plan. Each trend was supported with axial and open codes from the triangulation of data, including standardized open-ending interviews, observations, and document collection. Three key groups of participants were a major part of this qualitative case study: district administrators, teachers, and parents. Participants were interviewed to provide perceptions about the initial stages of reconfiguration and the reconfiguration itself. The overall findings and conclusions from this study showed that planning, communication, and superior leadership are keys to receiving viable results in a school-district restructuring. Recommendations for further study include (a) replication of this study in all middle schools in the district, (b) studying all middle schools in the state following the National Middle School Association Model, (c) focus on the academic achievement of students in the 5-7 configuration, and (d) interviews should include students who were impacted by the reconfiguration.

				"dc:description" : "Understanding citizens&apos; adoption of electronic-government (e-government) is an important topic, as the use of e-government has become an integral part of governance. Success of such initiatives depends largely on the efficient use of e-government services. The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model has provided a theoretical foundation for studying the adoption of e-services generally. At present, the UTAUT model does not provide for the variable of perceived trust, which this study believes to represent a significant limitation of the model. This study explores the integration of trust into UTAUT in an attempt to investigate how the revised model might better explain the citizens&apos; acceptance and adoption of e-government services. Therefore, in this quantitative, correlational survey study, data was obtained from a sample of a United States population. The research results, based on the hypotheses, indicated statistically significant positive relationship between perceived trust in e-government and behavioral intention to use e-government services, on one hand, and between perceived trust in the government and behavioral intention to use e-government services on the other. Based on the findings, the study concluded that there was significant, positive relationship between perceived trust and intention to use e-government services. Additionally, the study established that trust, gender, age, and experience significantly moderate the impact of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and the social influence on intention to use e-government services, though to different degrees.

				"dc:description" : "At San Joaquin Valley College, a culture of cultivating student learning through assessment was created in response to the Western Association of Schools and Colleges-Accrediting Commission of Community and Junior Colleges requirements for Fall 2012. In General Education, promoting and developing this culture has been more difficult with faculty teaching the curriculum across 11 campuses including: Aviation, Bakersfield, Fresno, Hanford, Hesperia, Modesto, Online, Rancho Cordova, Rancho Cucamonga, Temecula, and Visalia. A needs assessment was conducted to understand the climate of assessment based on the professional development for general education faculty at San Joaquin Valley College. Supported by the information gathered through the needs assessment and the research literature on assessment, teaching and learning, and faculty professional development, the model of a faculty learning community was found to be the best way to promote collaboration among faculty in all types of academic communities. At San Joaquin Valley College, a faculty learning community in general education was developed to focus on assessment efforts across all courses and campuses. This project, known as the general education faculty learning community, included faculty from all campuses and disciplines within general education. The general education faculty learning community members, through six months of training and collaboration, each developed trainings that they in turn conducted on their home campuses with general education faculty. This increased the overall professional development of all general education faculty on topics including assessment and student engagement. The faculty involved with the general education faculty learning community then focused on the goal of creating common and authentic assessments for general courses taught at San Joaquin Valley College by September 2012.

				"dc:description" : "The purpose of this qualitative study was to describe the lived experiences of primary classroom teachers participating in collaborative data-driven decision making. Hermeneutic phenomenology served as the theoretical framework. Data were collected by conducting interviews with thirteen classroom teachers who taught in grades kindergarten through third grade who participated in collaborative data-driven decision making with their grade level team. Those interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Item analysis was performed on the individual interviews and data were placed into a matrix. The matrix was then validated and unfolded during interviews with each team. The study focused on two questions. First, what is the experience of the classroom teacher as he or she participates in collaborative data-driven decision making? And second, how do teachers feel about collaborative data-driven decision making in practice? As a result of the study, eight themes emerged as the central experiences of teachers participating in collaborative data-driven decision making. Those themes included: Data, Team Dynamics, Collaboration, Efficacy, Time, Paperwork, Administration and Professional Development. Themes were identified through the analysis of the overall experience of the participant group of thirteen primary grade teachers representing four grade level teams. While commonalities exist among the themes, the overall experience of the participants identified both benefits of and barriers to effective collaborative data-driven decision making. This study has implications for schools that are currently implementing a collaborative data-driven decision making model, or for schools or districts that are considering utilizing a collaborative data-driven decision making model for continuous school improvement. Keywords: collaboration, data, data-driven decision making, hermeneutic, phenomenology, PLC, professional learning community, problem solving, response to intervention, RTI.

				"dc:description" : "The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of the picture plus discussion (PPD) intervention on the comprehension abilities of high school students with moderate intellectual disability when read a variety of expository texts aloud. A multiple probe single subject design was employed to measure the effect of the intervention across three different texts including leveled SRA readers, stories from a local newspaper, and sections from employee handbooks. Results indicate that the PPD intervention was successful in increasing comprehension as measured by the students&apos; story retell abilities. Comprehension assessment was collected in both three option knowledge based multiple-choice questions and student retell of the text content. While mixed results were observed in the multiple-choice accuracy, this study revealed that the PPD intervention was effective in increasing student comprehension by improving the story retell in terms of quantity (i.e. word count and idea units) and quality (i.e. text and picture relevant idea units) across the text types. These overall positive effects were replicated in the generalization phase, which involved peer supports in an inclusive, neutral school setting.

				"dc:description" : "The purpose of this study is to identify the critical events and support systems that have contributed to the attainment of an academic doctorate by Hispanics and to discern the similarities that existed in their parental educational level, socioeconomic status, and cultural background. The study will furthermore seek to identify major obstacles encountered by the subjects in attaining their degree and how the respondents dealt with the problems with which they were confronted. This analysis can be a tool for developing programs and support systems that will increase the number of future doctoral degree recipients. Consider that today Hispanics are the youngest population group in the United States; one-third of Hispanics are under 18 years of age, and they represent approximately 15% of the K-12 population. While the Hispanic population continues to grow, its educational achievement continues to lag behind the rest of the nation (Fry, 2003). This study concerning Hispanic American students who have attained an academic doctorate is descriptive in nature. A two-part questionnaire will be set up on an official internet based survey website, via Survey Monkey, as well as mailed to one hundred Hispanic American students who have earned a doctoral degree. A letter explaining the nature and purpose of the study will be included with each questionnaire. Every participant will be assured that their anonymity and confidentiality of information will be respected following standard research practices. If a questionnaire has not been returned by the end of three weeks, a follow-up letter of inquiry will be sent electronically, when possible, to verify receipt and anticipated date of return of the questionnaire. Telephone calls will also be made in order to provide quality follow-up with each prospective participant who requests further clarification or who may not have responded to each question. The first part of the questionnaire will request demographic information about each respondent, including parental education, cultural background, cultural orientation and socioeconomic characteristics. The second part of the questionnaire will garner information concerning critical events, support systems, and major obstacles encountered by the subjects in the pursuit and completion of the doctoral degree.

				"dc:description" : "This dissertation examines the social identity of adjunct faculty and the implications for writing program administrators (WPAs). With the ever increasing reliance on Master's degree teachers to teach first-year composition and other writing classes, WPAs are faced with the task of attempting to bring some level of disciplinary coherence to writing programs. This study consists of interviews of adjuncts at a Midwestern University that employed up to 50 adjuncts a year. Interview questions were developed using social identity theory. Interview results were analyzed via expertise and career theories. Findings indicate that adjuncts who do not have a Rhetoric and Composition PhD are unlikely to have a social identity as a member of the discipline and are unlikely to achieve expert status as disciplinary teachers. Recommendations are presented for strengthening writing programs and in addressing the national adjunct situation.

				"dc:description" : "Relationship marketing is attracting, maintaining, and, in multi-service organizations, enhancing customer relationships. Educational programs and services, like those of businesses, depend highly on the repeated purchases of their loyal customers. The purpose of this descriptive research is to investigate the relationships between factors that may lead to student loyalty in online graduate educational programs. Specifically, the study seeks to examine the relationships between service quality, technology, trust, commitment and satisfaction, reputation and ultimately loyalty. A new model is presented, which includes the results of testing these variables. The results of this study concluded that satisfaction with the program has the highest degree of association with student loyalty. Although service quality was found to be one of the key correlates to student loyalty to the program in face-to-face educational settings, it was found to be an insignificant element in assessing student loyalty to the program in online courses. Surprisingly, the construct of technology was found to be an important factor; specially, the role of using synchronous online tools. The findings also support relationship marketing theory (Morgan &amp; Hunt, 1994) and the roles of commitment and trust. However, this research found the role of commitment more important than that of trust. This study recognized reputation of the university as a vital mediator for building a mutually beneficial relationship between students and universities. The research includes implications to help service providers (educational institutions) improve their marketing strategies to ensure that online students (customers) remain with their desired online programs.

				"dc:description" : "Personal Health Records (PHRs) allow patients to access and in some cases manage their own health records. Their potential benefits include access to health information, enhanced asynchronous communication between patients and clinicians, and convenience of online appointment scheduling and prescription refills. Potential barriers to PHR use include lack of computer and internet access, poor computer or health literacy, security concerns, and provider disengagement. PHRs may help those living in rural areas and those with chronic conditions such as heart failure, monitor and manage their disease, communicate with their health care team and adhere to clinical recommendations. To provide some much needed actual research, a descriptive mixed methods study of the usability, usefulness, and disease management potential of PHRs for rural heart failure patients was conducted. Fifteen participants were enrolled. Usability issues fell into three categories: screen layout; applying consistent, standard formatting; and providing concise, clear instructions. Participants used PHR features that were more convenient than other methods or that had some additional benefit to them. There was no difference between rural and urban participants. A heart failure nurse promoted recording daily heart failure symptoms in the PHR. Most participants did so at least once, but many found it cumbersome. Reasons for recording included the comfort of having clinical staff monitor the data. Participants who were stable did not find recording as useful as did those who were newly diagnosed or unstable. Participants used asynchronous communication to send messages to the heart failure nurse that they would not otherwise have communicated. The study expands the knowledge of PHR use by addressing useful functionality and disease management tools among rural patients with heart failure. The patients were able to complete tasks they found useful. The increased communication and disease management tools were useful to some.

				"dc:description" : "The reading achievement of African American males might be impacted by a host of variables. This study was undertaken to determine if there was a difference in the culturally responsive characteristics present in the learning environment of a middle school and the reading achievement of middle school African American males. The purpose of this study was to provide greater clarity regarding the most productive learning environment for the reading achievement of African American males in a suburban middle school setting. This study utilized a mixed method research design. Three measures were used to collect data for this study. The data collection techniques included the use of an observation protocol, focus group interviews, and the administration of the Culturally Responsive Learning Environment Rating Scale (CRLE). The CRLE Rating Scale was developed by Dr. Joyce Miller, professor in the Curriculum and Instruction Department at Texas A&amp;M University-Commerce. The theoretical framework of James A. Banks&apos; (2001) total school environment was used as the basis of the CRLE Rating Scale. The findings of this study revealed in schools where African American males excel, the cultural learning environment of the school is characterized by standards of excellence that assist African American males with learning. The actions and/or activities of the school are supportive of African American males&apos; academic achievement. Culturally responsive instructional strategies and instructional materials are used to teach reading to African American males. In schools where African American males excel, the cultural learning environment is characterized by actions, activities, and technology assisting with communication between parents, students, teachers, and administrative staff regarding the African American males&apos; school involvement.

				"dc:description" : "A recent law in a New England state allowed public schools to operate with increased flexibility and autonomy through the authorization of the creation of Innovation Schools. This project study, a program evaluation using a convergent parallel mixed methods research design, allowed for a comprehensive evaluation of the first Innovation School (IS). Activity theory, which conceptualizes change in systems involving human interaction, was the theoretical foundation of this study. The research questions focused on the efficacy of the autonomous school redesign model in involving stakeholders in participatory decision making, improving teacher collaboration, expanding teacher empowerment, and increasing student achievement on a state standardized assessment. Descriptive and statistical analyses of a preestablished survey on teacher empowerment were used to collect data, and student achievement was examined via parametric statistical analyses of standardized state achievement assessments of 3rd, 4th and 5th grade students. Independent and paired t-test analyses documented significant increases in teacher empowerment and student achievement test scores associated with the IS model. Qualitative data, focus group and individual interviews, were analyzed through open coding and deriving summative themes of stakeholder perceptions to extend the quantitative results. The combined findings demonstrated that the IS model significantly impacted teacher empowerment and student achievement. The implications for social change lies in giving stakeholders a voice and decision making authority. As a result, schools can become organizations where stakeholders, regardless of race, color, national origin, or educational attainment, become responsible for issues related to the teaching and learning of the entire school community.

				"dc:description" : "Underachieving gifted students, described by Gowan (1955) as &quot;one of the greatest social wastes in our culture,&quot; are a challenge to educational stakeholders and a loss to society. Gifted children, who are often identified at an early age, possess unique talents and abilities that set them apart from their peers. Young gifted children are highly inquisitive, learn to read early, have extensive vocabularies, and think abstractly. When placed in an academically stimulating and nurturing environment, the abilities of young gifted children can be monitored and developed. However, when gifted students underachieve, their potential to contribute their unique insight, different perspective, and unparalleled thinking is impacted. The idea that the intellectually gifted will self-sustain academically is a common misconception found in schools and educational settings today. The purposes of this study were to determine if underachievement exists at the elementary school level, discover the onset of underachievement, and identify patterns of underachievement in elementary gifted students. The underachievement of students was determined by examining the archival data that included report card grades and the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) reading and mathematics performance over a five year period. The existing data of students who were identified in their 1st grade year as Gifted and Talented (GT) were analyzed to discover the onset of underachievement. Additionally, attendance data were examined, to identify patterns of underachievement. Descriptive statistics revealed that students experienced semesters of academic underachievement in the elementary school years. The descriptive statistics also indicated that some gifted students experienced an onset of underachievement as early as second grade. Statistical significance was found in the duration of underachievement between gifted achievers and gifted underachievers. Statistical significant differences were also found in the TAKS Reading and Mathematics scale scores of gifted achievers and gifted underachievers. No statistical significance was found in the attendance patterns of gifted students. The results of this research suggest that underachievement begins at the elementary level. It is important that educators monitor the achievement of students across the core subjects and consistently review students' performance on standardized assessments in hopes to prevent underachievement.

				"dc:description" : "In a large, urban, high school district, secondary English-learning students are not achieving at the same rates as other identified subgroups on state and local standardized tests. This gap compounds economic and social inequities in the region. A solution to the problem is important to educators and policy makers in providing an equitable education for all students. Using the conceptual framework of organizational culture, this qualitative project study explored the district&apos;s policies and practices on the academic program for English learners and whether policies result in meeting academic needs of English-learning students at the secondary level. One-on-one interviews with district personnel, observations in classrooms, and documents were analyzed using interpretive policy analysis. Three goals drove the data collection: (a) identify inconsistent or conflicting district policies; (b) identify the impact of district policies on diverse groups; and (c) determine a foundation for district administration to write policy. While no inconsistent or conflicting policies were identified, the evidence suggested the need for clear, frequent communication between the different policy actors and professional development for administrators and teachers in schools to create successful academic systems for English learners. Implications for positive social change are that these students will achieve greater academic success and be less likely to drop out of school.

In 2010, the performance levels of nonproficient reading students tested with the state reading test in Grades 9 and 10 declined from the 47th to the 46th percentile. The purpose of this research was to examine the effect of the questioning-as-thinking framework on comprehension levels in a high school setting and to test the intervention by comparing the results to a control group reading comprehension levels. The results provided data to administration to assess the needs of nonproficient students and the strategies they received to increase student learning. In the one-group pre- and posttest design, 75 Grade 11 and 12 students received questioning-as-thinking instructional strategies consisting of think-alouds, question-answer relationships, and self-questioning over a 9-week period. The repeated-measures, within-subjects ANOVA design assessed each questioning-as-thinking metacognition instructional strategy implemented in the study. The findings indicated a significant difference in reading comprehension for question-answer-relationship and self-questioning strategies but not for the think-aloud strategy. Comparison of treatment and control groups showed no statistical differences in reading comprehension. The implication for positive social change includes understanding better the strategies that effectively improve reading comprehension among high school students.

				"dc:description" : "Compliance with NCAA DI rules matters. The leaders of the NCAA, colleges and universities devise, negotiate and elect NCAA rules to address recurring problems. Despite these efforts, schools continue to violate NCAA rules. The objective intent of a rule is to affect a change in behavior; if behavior does not change, then the rule is ineffective. NCAA regulatory studies have determined that the NCAA selectively enforces its rules (Otto, 2006) and that compliance is explained as a result of economic, socio-cultural and institutional factors (Baxter &amp; Lambert, 1991; Clark &amp; Batista, 2009; Humphreys &amp; Ruseski, 2006; Stern, 1979, 1981). However, there has not yet been a systematic study of NCAA regulation to understand the degree to which compliance is a result of NCAA rules. This dissertation aims to fill this gap in the literature by conducting an evaluation of NCAA DI rules against the use of recruiting inducements in men's basketball. This dissertation examines particular NCAA rules that target essentially the same issue (recruitment inducements) and ties essential features of these rules to direct outcomes. The public reports of NCAA major infractions cases from 1952 to 2010 were analyzed and data was collected on past compliance, self-reporting, penalties, and the actors cited for rules violations. A Mann-Whitney U Test was used to evaluate the effect of NCAA rule reforms on compliance; the results showed that the reforms led to no significant change in compliance. The trend analyses of compliance, self-reporting, penalties and cited actors provided real world outcomes to test theoretical propositions on compliance. The framework of compliance (Mitchell, 1994) was applied in this dissertation to evaluate how the frame and structure of rules influence compliance. The empirical and analytical findings of this dissertation support the following contentions: NCAA rules, and their attendant monitoring and enforcement systems, do not function to support compliance. NCAA rules that impose rights and obligations on actors who lack the power, ability or incentives to fulfill such responsibilities will be less successful in gaining compliance. Finally, this dissertation highlights the considerable influence of private actors and the institutional hierarchy of power on NCAA compliance.

				"dc:description" : "This qualitative study explored community college student development during a study abroad program. The main research question was: How do community college students perceive the impact of participation in a study abroad program on their personal development? In addition, there were seven follow-up questions generated to understand students&apos; growth in variety of areas. The research questions were created based on Chickering&apos;s Theory of Student Development, which became the theoretical framework in this study. The data collection method consisted of four face-to-face semi-structured interviews. These in-depth, individual interviews were conducted with community college students who studied abroad. Eight themes related to the research questions were identified from participants&apos; reflections regarding their experiences during study abroad program. Among the most significant findings was students&apos; development in regard to their intellectual and emotional skills. Participants declared the increase in their level of independency and maturity. They became more self-directed and self-reliant individuals. Participants developed in areas of tolerance, understanding of differences, and diversity. The study participants progress across a majority of the vectors described by Chickering. Since the literature regarding education abroad in community colleges is limited, this research contributes to better understanding of the development of community college students during study abroad programs.

The purpose of this exploratory mixed-methods study was to explore whether there was a relationship between career exploration and the success of underrepresented students in higher education. Quantitative and qualitative data was collected. The Career Decision Self-Efficacy Scale Short Form (Betz &amp; Taylor, 1996) and the Career Information Form (Blair, 2010) were survey instruments utilized online to collect the data. Data obtained was analyzed utilizing descriptive statistics and the Pearson r coefficient. The qualitative data was analyzed in a narrative form utilizing themes derived from the data. The sample in the study were underrepresented students in higher education from a 4-year public university who had participated in a pre-college readiness program where they were exposed to and participated in career exploration activities. The results of the data identified the type and frequency of use of various career exploration activities by underrepresented students at a 4-year public university. Themes from the qualitative data suggested that experiential learning opportunities and career information activities are beneficial career exploration activities for underrepresented students in higher education. In summary, it can be derived from the data that underrepresented students who are exposed to career exploration activities may be more likely to be successful in higher education due to their goal selection and planning skills as a result of being exposed to career exploration activities.

				"dc:description" : "The Academy was an assessment enhancement program created by the HLC to help institutions strengthen and improve the assessment of student learning. Using a multiple case study approach, this study applies Argyis and Schon&apos;s (1976) Theory of Action to explore the espoused values and existence of Model I and II behavior characteristics. Argyis and Schon explained that a learning opportunity occurs as a result of an unintended consequence. Thus, the organizational characteristics, demonstrated through Model I and Model II descriptions, guide the organization&apos;s response to the learning moment. Model I organizations tend to operate with unilateral agendas and exhibit defensive behavior. Model I behavior is most closely associated with single-loop learning, which focuses on fixing an immediate problem with action-oriented responses. Model II organizations seek to demonstrate transparency, shared ownership, and public testing of ideas and assumptions. Thus, Model II organizations typically demonstrate double-loop learning. Double-loop learning continuously questions, critiques, and tests the underlying values and assumptions that led to an error. Double-loop learning is most closely associated with continuous improvement and a culture based on evidence, both of which are values of the Academy. While Academy participants typically described Model II characteristics in their efforts, their actions often reflect characteristics associated with Model I. In this study, the researcher found evidence of Model II behavior, but most institutions tended to exhibit Model I behavior. Institutions generally espoused the intention to improve the involvement of faculty and administration in assessment. Furthermore, participants hoped to demonstrate improvement-oriented and accountability-oriented outcomes. Several factors contributed to the disconnect between espoused and enacted practices, including the institution&apos;s rationale for joining the Academy; the success or momentum generated from pre-existing assessment initiatives; and the learning that is passed from an individual to the organization, especially at institutions with high administrative turnover. Institutions should have a general sense of their organizational characteristics because this allows stakeholders to test and possibly change practice. This study contributes to the growing research call for more strategies to promote double-loop learning. Institutions that engaged in collaborative processes, had leaders who championed assessment efforts, supported risk-taking, and distinguished mandates from improvement efforts were more likely to exhibit characteristics of Model II behavior.

				"dc:description" : "Not all students with disabilities receive special education accommodations in science class. Without special education support, students with disabilities are unable to comprehend and apply science concepts. Implementing a co-teaching model could be a remedy for this lack of supports. Framed by constructivist theory, this study sought to determine if there was a difference in science assessment scores between students in a co-taught science class and those in a regular education science class. Following a pretest-posttest control group design, this study examined the relation between two teaching models and achievement in science. Using a convenience sample of 84 students drawn from a population of 144 fourth grade special education students in a public school district located in the Southeastern United States, analysis of variance was used to compare the mean growth of the two groups. The data revealed no statistically significant difference in mean gain scores between the two groups. Additional studies using a larger sample and longer trial are needed. Implications for social change include understanding instructional strategies that allow educators to differentiate for diverse learners in mainstreamed classrooms as well as removing barriers for underrepresented groups, thereby allowing equal access to science related professions.

				"dc:description" : "Nursing education is a knowledge domain that requires higher order thinking (critical thinking) for making decisions that impact outcomes of human health. The goal of nursing education is to develop novice experts in nursing knowledge and clinical practice. In order to achieve this goal, nursing education must employ instructional approaches that are effective and efficient in developing higher order thinking and novice expertise. Instructional design theories can assist in achieving this goal. The &quot;conceptual elaboration sequencing&quot; (CES) approach from the elaboration theory of instruction proposes that application of the CES will promote learner engagement of higher order thinking and development of domain expertise. Using a post facto multiple case study design, this external validation study explored instructional strategies consistent with the CES approach from a research methods course taught within a nursing program. The constructs examined included the cognitive process of &quot;analysis&quot; and &quot;conceptual domain expertise.&quot; Nursing literature identifies &quot;analysis&quot; as the most common cognitive process examined in nursing education. Analysis is recognized as a cognitive process required for development of &quot;expertise&quot; according to the literature on critical thinking. Fourteen nursing students were designated as individual cases providing 42 sources of data. Interpretational analysis was used to identify units of analyses representative of the definition for the cognitive process of &quot;analysis,&quot; as defined by Bloom&apos;s Taxonomy, and &quot;conceptual domain expertise,&quot; as defined by elaboration theory of instruction. Descriptive analysis provided quantification of the interpretational analyses findings. In response to the instructional strategies consistent with the CES, the 14 cases provided evidence representative of the cognitive process of analysis and conceptual domain expertise. The current study provided replication from previous research findings that supports external validation of the CES. Replication of the study within nursing education would begin to build the body of evidence-based instructional practices called for by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing. The study extends the body of research on elaboration theory of instruction and provides preliminary research on the &quot;conceptual elaboration sequencing&quot; approach. The study offers instructional designers and practicing educators with an evidence-based instructional approach, that promotes higher order thinking, and is an approach that is consistent across multiple educational domains.

				"dc:description" : "The purpose of this study was to explore how the use of video in the cognitive task analysis (CTA) retrospective verbal protocol analysis (RVPA) during a job analysis affects: (a) the quality of performing the CTA, (b) the time to complete the CTA, and (c) the cost to execute the CTA. Research has shown when using the simultaneous VPA during a CTA can expect research participants to find the process laborious and obtrusive to perform. In addition, research participants may automate their task and some may find it difficult to speak out loud while performing the task. The researcher sought the answer to the research question by acquiring expert content through phenonological and structured interviews within two case studies (Group A and Group B) placed on two word tables for analysis. The analysis began with placing the coded data into themes to answer the research question. Based on the results of the coded data, Group A and Group B identified the same types of observable behaviors, but Group B captured 50% more observations than Group A. The second element of the research question asked if video improved the time to complete the CTA. Based on the findings of this study, Group A required less time to perform the RVPA. While Group B required more time to review video during the RVPA, he or she provided twice as much coded data than did Group A. The extra content collected by Group B established a robust pattern of behavior demonstrated by the truck driver. The third element of the research question asked if video improved cost to complete the CTA. While the Group B study cost more to peform than Group A, the only cost difference created in expenses were the mobile eyewear (video glasses). Although time and cost experienced no improvement per the research question, the researcher as HPT practitioner expects to present to the stakeholder how acquisition of the high quality content outweighs time and cost when examining the return on investment. Future research includes exploring how video fits within the various roles that HPT practitioners find themselves such as analyst, intervention specialist, change manager, and evaluator.

				"dc:description" : "The current state of health of the United States, including physical inactivity, dietary intake, and overall lifestyle habits is of concern for educators. Specifically, the health of the college population appears to be under-represented in health and wellness research. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a 15-week university wellness-based course on health indicators and six dimensions of wellness: physical, psychological, emotional, intellectual, social, and spiritual. The researcher hypothesized that students who participated in the wellness-based course (intervention group) would experience positive health outcomes and increased perceptions of wellness in the six areas of wellness. The intervention group consisted of 66 students (72.4% male). The control group had 58 students 57.6 male). Both groups completed pre-test and post-test health assessments (body mass index, body composition, resting heart rate, blood pressure). The Perceived Wellness Survey (PWS) was used for pre-test and post-test measures for perceived levels of wellness in the six dimensions. During the 15-week semester, the intervention group received wellness education following a curriculum that reviewed all areas of wellness and had an online physical activity tracking component. Statistical analyses for two of the five health indicators in the intervention group showed significant changes; body mass index (p &lt; 0.01, t = -2.21) and resting heart rate (p &lt; 0.001, t = 3.31). Perceived wellness scores from pre- to post-test were statistically significant in the intervention group for all six dimensions of wellness (p &lt; 0.001): psychological health (t = -7.28), emotional (t = -4.36), social (t = -3.90), physical (t = -3.38), spiritual (t = -5.56), and intellectual (t = -7.21). Additionally, post-test wellness scores for the intervention group were significantly higher than the control group (p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.001) in all six dimensions of wellness. The study findings provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of wellness education on the six areas of wellness for college students. The study provides a foundation for future research to evaluate the need for campus wellness initiatives and wellness-based education. In conclusion, university administrators and educators should consider the inclusion of wellness credits into the general education requirements to enhance wellness and encourage a holistic lifestyle that fosters academic success.

				"dc:description" : "This dissertation examined the perceptions of three itinerant deaf educators and three general educators at the elementary level on the deaf and hard-of-hearing (D/HH) push-in service model in one American southwestern, PK-12 public school district. Open-ended research questions guided the study on educator perceptions of the model in general and on the advantages, disadvantages, and the quality of the model. A qualitative research methodology with an exploratory, single case study design was used to answer these research questions. Data were collected through observations, one-on-one interviews, and a focus group interview. Major themes emerged from analysis of data: overall positive experience (general perceptions), immersion in general education (advantages), high noise levels (disadvantages), and dependent effectiveness (quality of the model). Implications for practice were considered, and recommendations were suggested for future research. Overall, participants were satisfied with the D/HH push-in model but collectively recommended a cluster site D/HH push-in service model for increased effectiveness.

				"dc:description" : "Higher education administrators are regularly involved in making decisions and creating policies that affect faculty, staff and students daily. Decision-making in our colleges and universities involves much more than one can imagine, thus, this study researches decision-making and its connection to non-knowing, anxiety, power, sovereignty, and identity. Decisions need to be seen as heterogeneous to knowledge. Therefore, this study views decision-making through the notion of undecidability as defined by Derrida (1976, 1992, 1995, 2002) and Caputo (1997A). Ultimately, undecidability impels us to search for the impossibility of decisions if we ever hope of changing the status quo in our colleges and universities.

				"dc:description" : "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 requires empirically based interventions to be used when treating chronic problem behaviors. The fundamental part of behavior modification is the ability to demonstrate that behavior change occurred due to the intervention. This can only be accomplished when the intervention is carried out as it was designed. The purpose of this study was to investigate elementary special education teachers' perceptions about the measures used to monitor the accuracy and consistency in which treatment interventions are implemented. Previous research has found that treatment integrity is not often assessed in the classroom, but few studies have examined the specific barriers that have led to this problem. Ten participants from three elementary schools, from a metropolitan area, participated in the study. Qualitative methods were used to gather information on the participants' perspectives using one-on-one interviews. The data collection instrument consisted of 11 open-ended questions and was validated by a panel of experts. Descriptive statistics and thematic coding were used to analyze the data. Results of the study indicated little to no measures are in place to monitor the degree to which interventions are implemented with accuracy, primarily due to lack of proper training and support.

				"dc:description" : "Nationally and in Indiana, the cultural mismatch can be seen in special education programs where minority students are overrepresented and most special educators are white (Arnold, 2003; Artiles et.al, 2005; Gaviria-Soto &amp; Castro-Morera, 2005). Teachers in general and special education teachers in particular need to be culturally competent. The objective of the study was to determine what inservice and preservice experiences related to cultural competence have Indiana special educators received, how Indiana special educators describe their personal and professional experiences related to cultural competence, and how Indiana special educators' experiences inform their attitudes and practices. The research was conducted in two parts. First, data were collected via Internet surveys from various types of educators across the state of Indiana. Second, 10 face-to-face interviews were conducted with special educators from all across the state of Indiana and including suburban, urban, and rural districts. The research used mixed methods in collecting and analyzing data. This particular research method was selected because of the need to have an understanding of the context in which special educators described their efforts to become culturally competent in their semi-structured interviews (qualitative research). Also, the need for statistical analyses (quantitative research) was utilized to understand and make inferences about the online survey results. Indiana special educators were not found to be particularly culturally competent. Also, it was determined that preservice and inservice experiences are not providing adequate preparation for special educators to teach the minority students who they are certain to encounter in the classroom. Instead, personal experiences were found to have provided the greatest benefit. However, even those special educators who recognized the importance of culture as a part of how students learn did not report altering their teaching practices to take advantage of this information. The implication for teacher education is that culturally responsive practices are an important and underemphasized part of teacher preparation programs emphasizing academic success for all students, including minorities and those with disabilities.

A faculty perception and motivations survey of online instruction was administered online in order to gather responses from the target audience of radiologic and imaging science program directors, clinical coordinators, and clinical and/or didactic faculty in a southern state to identify specific perceptions and motivations toward the use of online instruction to expand the teaching of radiologic and imaging sciences. Correlation and regression analysis were done to analyze the responses gathered from the online survey using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software program. Study results indicated that there is no significant relationship between (a) sociodemographic characteristics and faculty motivation regarding the use of online instruction, (b) personality traits and faculty motivation regarding the use of online instruction, (c) sociodemographic characteristics and faculty perception regarding the use of online instruction, and (d) personality traits and faculty perception regarding the use of online instruction. The fact that there is a limited amount of research focusing on demographic characteristics and personality traits influencing faculty perceptions and motivations regarding the use of online instruction in radiologic and imaging science, the insights gathered from this study could increase the understanding on the relationship between the stated variables.

				"dc:description" : "The current study evaluated the efficacy of a training series designed to teach typical school-based behavior support professionals to build behavioral interventions from functional behavioral assessment (FBA) information. The study was conducted in three stages. First, a descriptive assessment examined the extent to which typical school team leaders demonstrated knowledge of core behavior support plan (BSP) development features following a four-part training series on the development and implementation of function based supports. The second stage of the study assessed the extent to which participants who met criteria for BSP development during training were then able to lead a typical school team in building a BSP that was perceived by expert behavior analysts as &quot;technically sound.&quot; In the final stage, a nonconcurrent multiple-baseline design was used to determine if there is a functional relationship between implementation of BSPs led by typical school-team leaders who received the training and improvement in the level of student problem behavior. Thirteen school professionals participated in four 1-hour &quot;From Basic FBA to BSP&quot; training sessions. A post test analysis of BSP knowledge indicated that the participants ended training with the knowledge needed to use FBA information to develop student BSPs. Six of the 13 professionals went on to lead school-based teams in the development of BSPs that were rated by outside experts as technically adequate. Direct observation data were collected on student behavior during the implementation of five of the six resulting BSPs, and decreases in problem behavior and increases in academic engagement were seen for all five student participants. Additionally, participating team leaders and classroom staff indicated that they found the procedures and tools used to be both acceptable and effective. These results document preliminary findings supporting the efficacy of a four-part training series used to teach typical school staff to use FBA data in designing student BSPs. Further implications for practice in schools and directions for future research are discussed. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

				"dc:description" : "This study focuses on the experiences faculty had in the support provided to them in technology implementation and the role of faculty professional development to ensure its implementation. In today's world, higher education institutions are making a transition from a traditional way of teaching and learning to a blended approach where technology is implemented. Faculty members are expected to implement technology in their classrooms and support must be provided to ensure effective implementation. Offering faculty support without understanding their experiences may lead to ineffective technology implementation and frustration. The purpose of this qualitative research was to investigate the experiences of the faculty members and clarify the role of faculty professional development to support them in the implementation of technology. The researcher adopted a qualitative approach influenced by phenomenology and used the modified van Kaam method by Moustakas with in-depth interviews to gain a better understanding of twelve faculty members' experiences at Lebanese higher education institutions. The analysis of the transcribed interviews revealed five emerging themes: partial satisfaction with the support department, partial satisfaction with the training workshops, need for motivation, need for peer support, and need for technology use to be institutionalized. The conclusions drawn from the project suggest the need for more support within institutions and a change in the mindset of support providers. Knowledge of the current and best practices concerning the issues in technology integration provided the researcher with tools both to compare practices and to provide coordinators, administrators, and program leaders with a set of recommendations when planning faculty professional development activities.

				"dc:description" : "The period of transition from high school is challenging for most adolescents. There are a substantial number of life-changing decisions that transpire during this time. Choices must be made regarding career paths, continued education, future residence, and avenues for social activities and general integration in the community. Person-centered planning provides a structure for addressing these questions, with the interests and aspirations of the individual at the forefront. While much has been written about person-centered planning, there is still a sparse evidence base to support its use and no formal examination of the fidelity of implementation of these programs. This study utilized a multiple-baseline single subject design to assess the effects of structured meetings with performance feedback on fidelity of implementation of participants&apos; action plan steps in their person-centered plan. Analysis of the results suggests a strong functional relation between the use of structured follow-up with performance feedback and activity related to the person-centered plan action plan. Quality of life data were also gathered prior to planning and prior to and following the performance feedback intervention, with little change in the scores across the three points in time. Social validity was also assessed. The implications of these findings are discussed. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

				"dc:description" : "This study included a literature review of juried research studies of student achievement factors that affect African American achievements tracked in the No Child Left Behind Legislative Act. Statistical correlation analyses were performed to determine if the absence or presence of one or two-parents in the household affected student achievement of the characteristic &quot;exurban&quot; research study public school district. The exurban public school district studied achieved Adequate Yearly Progress in every single one of its schools in 2009. The study was focused on the school district because of the existence of exurban African American household student population study groups for comparative data analyses in the residential research study setting. The study sought to determine if those African American subgroup household sizes were correlative for higher or lower achievement in student reading test scores when compared to long standing national African American Achievement gap evidenced in the National Assessment of Educational Progress and which has remained persistent. The study also examined the norm referenced Iowa Test of Basic Skills in peer household size &quot;intra comparative&quot; population study groups in reading achievement scores for national percentile ranking scores of exurban African American students' achievement for correlative effect. The research study groups matriculated in an extant exurban setting of a southeastern American public school district some 40 miles outside the major metropolitan area of Atlanta, Georgia. The study's findings revealed an &quot;absent or minimal African American achievement gap&quot; in most cases of the reading achievement NPR scores of exurban African American students. The study failed to reject all three of the null hypotheses with no statistically significant correlations using the Pearson Product Moment correlation among parent household size and reading achievement scores. However, an ANOVA test for the students' mean National Percentile Reading scores based on four population groups was significant (p = 0.001). The mean NPR for the two groups of gifted/advanced education students were found to be at least 30 points higher than for the two groups of regular education students in the exurban school district studied.

				"dc:description" : "This dissertation proposal begins with a discussion about how the education of game programmers was not meeting the needs of the game industry. With this problem identified, this study proceeded to verify the existence of disparities of current game programming curricula. The findings from the literature review were able to: (a) justify the need to develop a career-oriented instructional design model for education of game programming; (b) identify the disparities that caused the mismatch of instructional content between academia and the game industry; (c) review research that contributed to the identification of three disparities: curriculum objectives and structure, instructional content, and curriculum orientation; (d) discuss theories and models of instructional design, student engagement, and related pedagogies; and (e) explore how these theories and models might be instrumental in improving education of game programming. The results obtained from the literature review were also used to formulate guidelines for investigating the status of currently available curricula in game programming. The research design and the research methods utilized by this study to examine the research questions are also described in detail. Four research questions were used to guide the study with the goal of identifying or forming a guiding principle for developing an instructional design model for a career-oriented education of game programming professionals. The results of this study indicated that all of the investigated game programming curricula had not yet produced graduates whom the game companies are interested in hiring as game programmers and that educational institutions had missed an opportunity to equip students with the proper programming skills for the game industry. Furthermore, this study identified that an accreditation standard as well as an industry-accepted instructional design model was not yet available to reflect the personnel hiring requirements of the game industry. The curriculum and coursework must be career-oriented and instructional content must center on game programming. Game programming pedagogy must lead to development of core competencies. In reviewing these findings, the guiding principles for developing an instructional design model became clear. The contribution of this study was to present an immediately applicable instructional design model that could be used as a basis by schools to create or fine tune their game programming curricula. The completed model is provided as an attachment to this dissertation. This proposed instructional design model is intended to provide an initial basis towards a solution to minimize the disparities between academia and the game industry in educational areas of curriculum orientation, curriculum objectives and structure, and instructional content. As with any problem solution, future study and analysis should be done in order to optimize and standardize a game programming curriculum that will be accepted by the game industry as well as accredited by a mutually accepted accreditation body.

The purpose of this study was to determine the following: 1) are postconventional stages of ego development evidenced in school superintendents; 2) do the number of years in career as superintendent relate to later stages of ego development; and 3) are there significant themes belonging to superintendents in the same stage of ego development as they describe what is valuable and important to them when discussing school policy and decision-making. Three stages of ego development [Expert (3/4), Achiever (4), Individualist (4/5)] were identified in this sample. More number of career years as a superintendent did not suggest later stages of ego development. Themes related to what superintendents described as important and valuable when discussing school policy and decision-making emerged in each of the ego stages identified by the Sentence Completion Test-Leadership Maturity Framework (SCTi-MAP) assessment.

				"dc:description" : "In the hotel industry, social media marketing has become a new trend hoteliers are chasing and an increasing number of hotels are using social media to promote their business. However, the marketing effectiveness of social media is still a big challenge in both academic and business world. Since social media marketing is totally different from traditional marketing approaches, traditional marketing theories and practices may not be applicable to social media. Besides, very few studies have examined the effectiveness of social media marketing in the academic world. Therefore, this study intended to provide an in-depth examination on the marketing effectiveness of Facebook, the most commonly used social media site, in the hotel industry. The study explored the marketing effectiveness of Facebook from both customer and message perspectives. From the customer perspective, the antecedents of marketing effectiveness were analyzed through an online survey. From a message perspective, different types of messages posted on hotel Facebook pages by hotels were categorized and the marketing effectiveness of different messages was compared using an experiment design. Finally, combining antecedents with outcomes, the study proposed an integrative model of hotel Facebook marketing mechanism. To achieve these objectives, the study used mixed methods and was comprised of three sub-studies. The first sub-study employed an online survey to understand the antecedents that drive people to join hotel Facebook pages. The sub-study proposed three competing theoretical models, technology model, communication model, and social psychology model, to compare the extent to which the three models can explain customers&apos; intention to join hotel Facebook pages. The social psychology model was tested to be the best model and three factors were identified to influence customers&apos; intention to join hotel Facebook pages. Among them, internalization and identification had positive effects while compliance had a negative effect. Thus, Facebook marketing was more like a social phenomenon influenced by social interactions than a simple technology innovation or a communication platform. The second sub-study was a qualitative study that uses content analysis to collect data from 12 sample hotel brand Facebook pages and develop a classification of messages posted on hotel Facebook pages by hotels. A 4-type message format and 6-type message content classification was identified. In terms of message format, picture was more marketing effective than word, web link and video formats. In terms of message content, brand, product, and involvement messages had better marketing effectiveness than promotion, information, and reward messages. Promotion message was the worst message content type in terms of marketing effectiveness. Thus, Facebook works best for hotels to build brands, introduce new products, and interact with customers, while it is not a good platform for hotels to announce promotions and deals. The third sub-study conducted an online experiment to compare the marketing effectiveness of different types of messages on hotel Facebook pages. A 3 x 3 two-factor (message format and message content) between-subjects design was employed. Word, picture, and web link were chosen as the message format levels. Brand, product, and involvement were chosen as the message content levels. A hotel brand &quot;Starhill&quot; was created and nine simulated hotel Facebook pages with nine different types of messages were developed. Participants were randomly assigned to read one Facebook page with one type of message and then complete a questionnaire on message marketing effectiveness. Significant interaction effects were found on attitude toward the hotel Facebook page, hotel booking intention, and electronic word-of-mouth. Picture messages are better than word and web link messages in generating positive attitudes among customers, while word and web link messages do better in inducing more customer intentions. Besides, Brand messages work better in picture format while product messages do better in word and web link formats. This study had both theoretical and practical significance. Theoretically, this study was one of the first attempts about marketing effectiveness of social media using mixed methods and tried to identify the underlying theoretical models of social media marketing in the hospitality field. The integrated model of hotel Facebook marketing mechanism proposed in the study represents an important advancement in the theoretical research regarding social media marketing, particularly in the hotel industry context. Practically, this study can be used as a guideline for Facebook usage in the hotel industry. The study provided the hotel industry two types of suggestions in leverage Facebook marketing. On the customer side, hotels should reinforce their customers&apos; social identity on their hotel Facebook pages through the creation of a social community and create message contents conforming to the norms and value systems of customers. On the message side, hotels should balance Facebook message format and carefully choose the best message format based on the message content and the purpose of the messages. In terms of message content, brand, product, and involvement messages should be the first choices of hotel Facebook messages. Hotels should avoid using promotion messages a lot.

				"dc:description" : "This study sought to evaluate the effect of participation in the Student-Guided Supports (SGS) curriculum on student behavior. The SGS curriculum was designed to teach students a set of simple behaviors to prompt and reinforce supportive teacher behavior. Student use of the SGS behaviors was hypothesized to initiate a constructive cycle of student-teacher interactions that increase teacher display of supportive behaviors and student display of SGS behaviors and academic engagement. Results of the study provided evidence of a functional relation between participation in the SGS curriculum and increased student use of requests for teacher feedback. They also provided evidence of a functional relation between student requests for feedback and teacher provision of feedback. While this study did not provide evidence of the establishment of constructive cycles of support it did offer the following: a) high school teachers typically engaged in low levels of the identified support behaviors, and b) students were able to reliably elicit these supportive behaviors by engaging in relatively simple prompting behaviors. Potential implications of the results and future research are discussed. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

In this study, I first introduce the significance of studying the relationship between ELL reading development and the reading teaching activities recommended for ELL students&apos; reading development and discuss the potential conflicts of the ideas underlying these teaching activities with some assumptions underlying the second language theories. With such an introduction as a base, I raise some research questions for my dissertation study and review the relevant theoretical and empirical bases and further justify these research questions in light of the theoretical and empirical literature. Then, I propose and justify the research methodology, participants, data sources and analyses for my dissertation and present my findings that address the research questions. Finally, I discuss these findings in light of the existing literature, offer pedagogical implications and suggestions for future research on ELL reading, and explain imitations of study.

				"dc:description" : "This work deals with a number of issues relating to the multifaceted phenomenon of audiovisual translation. The primary concern of the dissertation is with the evaluation of translation strategies of extralinguistic culture-bound references, in particular, in films dubbed from English (as the source language) into Ukrainian (as the target language). In the light of the multiplicity of semiotic codes involved, current audiovisual translation theories are not adequate to account for all factors that contribute to a successful translation. Besides this polysemiotic nature, audiovisual translation is complicated when there is a heavy load of culture-specific elements. Furthermore, it is not easy to define the notion of a culture-bound reference in itself, and the proximity and/or remoteness of source and target cultures may create different degrees of the so-called &quot;culture bumps&quot; (Leppihalme, 1993) during the process of translation. This work focuses on instances of &quot;culture bumps&quot; in five computer animated comedies dubbed from English into Ukrainian, namely--&quot;Ratatouille&quot; (2007), &quot;Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs&quot; (2009), &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot; (2010), &quot;Shrek Forever After&quot; (2010), and &quot;Cars 2&quot; (2011). The films were selected with consideration of idiosyncratic contextualizations that do not necessarily explicitly 'belong' culturally to either of the two cultural contexts considered, the original U.S. or the Ukrainian one. None of the films are overtly embedded in the U.S. culture, and the viewer must be familiar with it in order to attribute the films to the latter. The uniqueness of the complexity of translation of these films is revealed even more in the particular context of audiovisual translation in Ukraine. Only in 2006 the Cabinet of Ukraine passed a decision about mandatory dubbing, voice-over or subtitling of all foreign films from its original language into the Ukrainian language. One of the first films subject to this law was the animated feature &quot;Tachki&quot; (&quot;Cars&quot;) which was dubbed into Ukrainian. The translation was a huge success, and some regard this as the beginning of the promotion of the Ukrainian language and culture via the film industry. Due to the complicated history of the state, including seventy years under the Soviet regime, the language situation in Ukraine is very complex. Since Ukraine gained its independence in 1989, Ukrainian has been the officially recognized state language according to the Constitution of Ukraine. This led to slow implementation of the Ukrainian language usage both on the state and local levels and caused significant steps towards de-russification of the public sphere. By the directive of the President of Ukraine from August 27, 2003 the State Television and Radio Committee of Ukraine became responsible for implementation of the state language policy of Ukraine on television and radio. Although historically a voice-over country (as a part of the Soviet Union, where this particular audiovisual technique was introduced), Ukraine now favors dubbing. This is in part due to the relatively small percentage of the population that speaks English (which is the top language of imported AV production worldwide). It is also a method of promoting the usage of Ukrainian on the everyday level, and raising its prestige in the country, especially with younger generations. The relationship between these factors and the strategies chosen by translators when dubbing foreign films into Ukrainian is among the key issues of interest in this thesis. An important factor that contributed to the emphasis on the animated films, as opposed to other genres, was that the mandate of the Cabinet, first of all, oriented on younger audiences. It is my hypothesis that, due to the Ukrainian language promotion policy and the particular audience targeted, the animated films dubbed into Ukrainian will be &quot;heavier&quot; in the strategies that seek to embed the films into the Ukrainian context. The analysis performed in this study revealed the symbiotic relationship between the national policy on language and choice of AVT mode, as well as translation strategies and its quality.

				"dc:description" : "One of the objectives of the U.S. government has been the development of a nationwide health information infrastructure, including adoption and use of an electronic health records (EHR) system. However, a 2008 survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics indicated a 41.5% usage of the EHR system by physicians in office-based practices. The purpose of this study was to explore opinions and beliefs on the barriers to the diffusion of an ERH system using Q-methodology. Specifically, the research questions examined the subjectivity in the patterns of perspectives at the preadoption stage of the nonusers and at the postadoption stage of the users of an EHR system to facilitate effective diffusion. Data were collected by self-referred rank ordering of opinions on such barriers and facilitators. The results suggested that the postadoption barriers of time, change in work processes, and organizational factors were critical. Although the time barrier was common, barriers of organizational culture and change in work processes differed among typologies of perspectives at the postadoption stage. Preadoption barriers of finance, organizational culture, time, technology, and autonomy were critical. The typologies of perspectives diverged on critical barriers at the preadoptive stage. A customized solution of an in-house system and training is recommended for perspectives dealing with technical and organizational concerns and a web-based system for perspectives concerned with barriers of finance, technology, and organization. The social impact of tailoring solutions to personal viewpoints would result in the increased sharing of quality medical information for meaningful decision making.

				"dc:description" : "Speech prosody is a multi-faceted dimension of speech which can be measured and analyzed in a variety of ways. In this study, the speech prosody of Mandarin L1 speakers, English L2 speakers, and English L1 speakers was assessed by trained raters who listened to sound clips of the speakers responding to a graph prompt and reading a short passage. In order to eliminate other factors that might distract from assessing only the prosodic &quot;goodness&quot; of a given speaker, the sound clips were acoustically filtered to attenuate all frequencies 500 Hz and above. This cut-off was used with the aim of preserving prosodic characteristics without including interference from segmental features where possible. The raters who participated in this study were trained to use the OEPT (Oral English Proficiency Test) scale to rate holistic speech in an unfiltered condition so this study employs an adapted version of that scale. The levels of the adapted scale were as follows: (1) L1 Mandarin Prosody, (3) L2 Novice English Prosody, (5) L2 Intermediate English Prosody, (7) Advanced English Prosody, (9) L1 English Prosody. For each sound clip, the raters were asked to assign one of these proficiency levels and describe in qualitative terms why they choose that score. EFL students from different universities in China were also asked to complete this task of rating filtered speech along the same scale. The resulting analysis will examine the usefulness of rating prosody through filtered speech for L2 prosody assessment as well as its potential benefits for prosody pedagogical development.

				"dc:description" : "The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between career college students' perceptions of the online learning environment and their overall satisfaction with the learning experience. Additionally, student perceptions of the online learning environment were compared with those of their instructors, in order to determine similarities and differences in perceptions between both groups. Career college student and instructor perceptions of the online learning environment were assessed using the Distance Education Learning Environment Survey. Student perceptions of the online learning environment were measured and compared to those of their instructors. Aspects of the online learning environment that were assessed included the following areas: instructor support, student interaction and collaboration, personal relevance, authentic learning, active learning, student autonomy, and overall satisfaction. Because the focus of this research study is to contribute to the literature on career college institutions and their students, the target population was career college students within the state of Minnesota taking online courses. A total of 276 participants took part in the study. Demographic data were also gathered to investigate additional outside factors. The study's findings identified significant differences between student and instructor perceptions on subscales of instructor support, personal relevance, active learning, and student autonomy. Instructors also had a significantly lower overall satisfaction score. The results of the study supported previous research that students place a significant value on instructor support and interaction within the online learning environment as well as a curriculum that is personally relevant and meaningful and encouraging active learning. Moreover, the results of the study revealed that student perceptions differed from instructor perceptions. Therefore, this finding could guide the development of strategies for instructors in order to improve online learning environments in career college institutions.

Over the course of ten months, pre-service teachers completed two Early Childhood Special Education practica in diverse urban communities. The pre-service teachers were placed in public practica programs that served dual language learners with Individual Education Plans (IEPs) and Individual Family Service Plans (IFSPs). Practica interactions with parents, children, and staff integrated theory from fieldwork into weekly seminar discussions about dialogue skills and culture in Special Education. The pre-service teachers identified strategies they used collaboratively to welcome, make sense of, and create options within challenging interactions at their practica. Skilled Dialogue (Barrera and Kramer, 2009) was adapted as the framework for this study. The three pre-service teachers represented three different cultural and linguistic backgrounds in a multilingual, multicultural cohort of Masters and credential students in Early Childhood Special Education.

				"dc:description" : "The study aimed to explore how John A. Henschke&apos;s practice mirrors the andragogical theory espoused in his scholarship. This study offered interpretations held by three groups of individuals: colleagues, students, and John, utilizing 10 data sets. Data sets include: a) Focus group-current students, b) Modified Instructors Perspectives Inventory for Students pre/ post course surveys, c) Section of the Instructors Perspectives Inventory, d) Course evaluations, e) Video recordings of John facilitating, f) Interviews; colleagues, students, and John, g) Observations, and h) Selection of scholarship. Each contained interpretations and perceptions that, when held up to the mirror of John&apos;s scholarship, reflected an image of John addressing the research question, &quot;How does John A. Henschke&apos;s practice mirror the andragogical theory espoused in his scholarship?&quot; This study utilized a version of an instrument developed by John, the Instructional Perspectives Inventory (IPI), which was modified for student use. If learners and John did not have congruent perceptions of John&apos;s practice as evaluated by an instrument that John himself developed, then not only would the instrument be in question, but so would John&apos;s practice. The IPI identified seven characteristics of the adult educator; this study used these characteristics as pre-determined themes. The study identified three additional themes for a total of 10 themes. This study placed emphasis on teacher trust of learners. This research produced an instrument as a complement to the MIPI-S, the Visible Elements of Trust Inventory (VETI), which demonstrates the behavioral embodiment of the beliefs and feelings of teacher trust of learners. The VETI was used to evaluate video recordings of John facilitating adult education. The findings of this study are situated, as a mirror. The image reflected of John&apos;s practice and scholarship was congruent. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

				"dc:description" : "This qualitative study explored the ability of a linked learning career and technical education program to engage fully students and thereby increase at-risk students' persistence in school. The focus was to identify the degree to which linked learning career and technical education programs provide a community atmosphere, increase and maintained student engagement, and prepare students to compete in a global economy. An educational community in this study is defined as a place where all members of the community (administrators, teachers, students, and employers or intern sites) share in its leadership. There is a shared set of values and covenants and moral leadership, where the teachers and other members of the community manage themselves because it is the right thing to do, not for some reward or to avoid a consequence. The study site served 100 high schools in a diverse county in southern California with a large gang population and students from very low to very high socioeconomic status. Through in-depth interviews and surveys, the study found the teachers, students, and administrators described the atmosphere as a family. The teachers and administrators were tightly knit and worked well together. The intern sites and employers had direct communication with the program, provided feedback to improve the program, and the program responded by making changes to improve the program. Student engagement was high, there were virtually no problems among the students, and there were strict rules and standards. The findings indicate that linked learning career and technical education programs provide a community atmosphere that keeps at-risk students in school. In addition, the teachers, administrators, intern sites, and students worked together to maintain the community and create a family atmosphere where student needs are the central focus of all the community efforts.

				"dc:description" : "The purpose of this study was to examine efficacious teaching-learning strategies that community college stakeholders employ that enhance surgical technology student outcomes. Knowles&apos;s adult learning theory, constructivist theory, and appreciative inquiry served as the theoretical foundation for this study. Discovering effective aspects and strategies will help stakeholders improve students&apos; learning; therefore, support students in their efforts to pass the certification examination and successfully find employment as a surgical technologist. A qualitative case study design involving individual interviews and focus group interview of past graduates, adjunct faculty, and clinical site personnel, along with a document review was used to collect data that address how surgical technology students learn best in order to be successful on the exam and in their career. Data analysis strategies included coding and development of recurrent appreciative inquiry themes. Key results discovered from the study included the significance of developing a state of the art laboratory facility and the value of teaching surgical technology material using differentiated instruction. Discovery of current efficacious teaching-learning strategies shaped the resulting project, which was creation of a changed curriculum with lesson plans incorporating efficacious teaching-learning and differentiated instructional strategies. Implementing the recommended curriculum changes that incorporate and capitalize on these effective strategies can potentially improve the overall education and comprehension of surgical technology students as they transition from the classroom to the operating room. Implications for positive social change include improving students&apos; knowledge and application of surgical technology in order to positively impact the lives of patients whom they serve.

				"dc:description" : "The purpose of this study was to evaluate and determine how special education teachers perceived the effectiveness and impact of NCLB and IDEA on the academic achievement of high school students with disabilities. The purpose of the &quot;No Child Left Behind Act&quot; (NCLB) and the &quot;Individuals with Disabilities Education Act&quot; (IDEA) was to bridge the achievement gap among students and to ensure they developed proficiency in focus subjects. One of the NCLB goals was to staff each classroom with a special education teacher. According to the study findings, special education teachers believed that NCLB did result in significant improvement of instructional methods. Study results indicated that the implementation of IDEA did lead to significant improvement of instructional methods. Study findings showed that educators perceived the NCLB strategies did lead to a decrease in the achievement gap between the two groups of high school students. This study used a quantitative descriptive research methodology to evaluate the perceived level of effectiveness of NCLB and IDEA strategies in the special education program. Use of a quantitative research methodology enabled the researcher to determine, measure, and analyze data to test the hypotheses developed from the three research questions. The population of interest consisted of special education teachers, specifically the highly qualified special education teachers. The research instrument for the study was a survey questionnaire distributed to 130 special education teachers. The selected sample included highly qualified and effective high school special education teachers from five urban inner-city schools in an urban Midwestern U.S. school district. This sample was selected because these teachers were the ones executing and evaluating the effectiveness of NCLB and IDEA and they could describe the tangible implications of the changes. The findings of this research are important because they provide noteworthy insight into NCLB and IDEA strategies for improving the academic achievement of students with disabilities. This study establishes that more efficient instructional practices and educational leadership are significant requisites for improving the quality of education for students with disabilities.

				"dc:description" : "This qualitative case study examined the degree to which one faith-based school perceived its capacity to support students with special needs and how those perceptions influenced decisions regarding student enrollment based upon current special needs practice policies for students with disabilities. While faith-based schools can be seen as a promising option for parents seeking religious education, this option is limited for parents of children with special needs. Inclusion in faith-based schools is (based upon the perception of the capacity of the school to enroll students with special needs) and not legal compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The requirements to teach in a California public school system are substantially different than those employed in a faith-based school. Teachers there not only need a degree and teaching credential, but also need to espouse basic Christian beliefs. The study further examined the degree to which addressing academic needs and providing interventions supported special needs students in faith-based schools. An integral element of the interventions provided was the provider's professional qualifications and/or certifications. The pertinent themes that emerged from this study were capacity, vocation, school culture, legal knowledge, and inclusion. An examination of these themes informed the researcher of the unique qualities that characterize faith-based institutions. The study was significant because it established a basis for the institutional ethos for the actions, services, and policies of faith-based schools regarding special needs students. The study also found that integrating special needs students could be accomplished with a change of educational policy and outreach. The study concluded that the ability of faith-based schools to provide special needs education is a direct correlation to a principal's attitude about inclusion and how the principal perceives the school's capacity to deal with special needs students as the principal makes corresponding decisions on enrolling these students.

				"dc:description" : "Pierre Bourdieu&apos;s theory of cultural and social reproduction (Bourdieu 1973; Bourdieu and Passeron 1977) offers a model that can be used to explain the existence of persistent educational stratification in the United States, which contributes to perpetuation of social inequality, more generally. This theoretical model purports three mechanisms through which structured social inequalities are perpetuated and reproduced: (1) the effective transmission of family-based cultural knowledge and skills to children, (2) teachers&apos; and schools&apos; preference for students who possess these family-based cultural resources (in favor of upper- and middle-class children), which influences academic achievement, and (3) the cumulative effect of high achievement at the start of school--as a result of having entered the school system with cultural resources valued by the education system--on subsequent achievement. While qualitative research has provided evidence in support of Bourdieu&apos;s framework, quantitative research has not confirmed Bourdieu&apos;s propositions. I used data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD) to investigate the mechanisms through which family-based, school-based and cumulative processes contribute to early educational achievement. I asked the following questions: (1) How large are the SES effects on academic achievement (math and reading) prior to schooling (age 4&amp;frac12;), and how much of the difference is mediated by family-based cultural resources (parental habitus and parenting practices)?; (2) Do kindergarten teachers perceive themselves as closer to students with higher levels of SES (net of the student&apos;s academic abilities), and do kindergarten teachers&apos; ratings mediate the relationship between SES and academic achievement in first grade?; (3) Does SES have effects on academic achievement post school entry (first grade), even when controlling for academic achievement prior to school entry, family-based cultural resources, and the student-teacher relationship? This study finds that family-based cultural resources partially mediate the effect of SES on first grade academic achievement, and the student-teacher relationship does not mediate the effect of SES on first grade academic achievement. Further, this study finds some support for a cumulative effect of (dis)advantage. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

				"dc:description" : "I do two things in my dissertation. One is to tell the history of academic research on my language from the perspective of a Native person who has been involved in this work as an assistant to non-Native researchers. The other is to explain more about my culture and language and how it works from the perspective of a Yakima person who has spoken and used the language her whole life. My most important task in this dissertation is to explain at more length some of the most basic vocabulary about our ancient culture and way of life. I do this by writing about different important parts of traditional life--life circles, sweathouse, ceremonies, horses, and foods--and explaining the words we use to talk about these and how those words explain the deeper meaning of what we do. I write this dissertation for the Ichishkiin speaking communities in hope that by documenting our lost traditions they will have a resource from which to learn our ancestors&apos; ways and language. Detailing the traditional practices offers a much needed historical and social accounting of each. I include various dialects and practices shared by other Ichishkiin speaking communities. I incorporate texts, songs, descriptions of dances, and practices in Ichishkiin. This dissertation contributes also to the fields of sociolinguistics and theoretical linguistics, as well as historical and cultural anthropology. Despite the best efforts of some anthropologists and linguists, all the work done on Yakima Ichishkiin is by researchers from outside the community and is inevitably seen and presented through the lens of the English language, Euro-American culture, and the Western tradition of &quot;objective&quot; scholarship. I am in a unique position to present the research on my language as a contribution to academic scholarship but from a very different perspective, that of a Native speaker and scholar. Implicit in my view of scholarship is the way researchers should work with Native people; therefore, I address how linguists can better work with community members.

				"dc:description" : "This study sought to describe perceptions of teachers regarding the influence of online professional development (oPD) in literacy on their instruction and students&apos; learning. The following features of effective professional development were analyzed: content-focus; collectivity; coherence; duration; and active learning. As well, the study analyzed viability of oPD to improve teachers&apos; capacities, teaching practices, and students&apos; learning. Three voluntary users of oPD provided data from logs, interviews, and surveys. They reportedly perceived oPD as convenient, nonthreatening, and time well-spent. Additionally, participants agreed that they learned new knowledge and skills as a result of oPD. Two of the three participants reportedly perceived that their oPD experiences reflected the five features of effective PD. One participant reportedly perceived oPD to have four of five features, with collectivity as an absent feature. Participants reported that oPD positively impacted their teaching and student learning. This study found that voluntary users of oPD in literacy were largely satisfied with their oPD experiences. The study made two recommendations: first, districts should provide structure to encourage shared learning from oPD. Second, districts must balance opportunities to disseminate professional knowledge and build initiatives with self-navigated oPD.

				"dc:description" : "Gender and faculty career advancement have been examined with a focus on academic work environment, including faculty workloads, mentoring relationships, access to research networks, and work-life balance. Previous studies concerned with gender, employment, and care work only have considered child care. Additionally, the exploration of faculty and care work focused specifically on gender instead of examining the interaction of race and gender. To date, no study on academic work-life policies includes faculty perceptions of their importance and effectiveness nor has the faculty assessment of eldercare policy been examined in relation to career success. Guided by an intersectional perspective, this study compares responses provided by four groups of faculty: African American women, African American men as well as white women and white men. Toward this end, I use data from the 2008 and 2009 Tenure-Track Faculty Job Satisfaction survey collected by the Collaborative on Academic Careers in Higher Education (COACHE). First, I examine faculty perceptions regarding the importance of family policies as related to career success, the effectiveness of family policies at the institution, and the level of satisfaction with work-life balance. Second, I examine the extent to which departmental and institutional support for care work affects the faculty member&apos;s overall satisfaction with the institution. The findings indicate that there are significant differences in policy perceptions within the intersectionally defined faculty groups as well as with overall satisfaction with work-life balance. African American women overwhelmingly indicate that eldercare policy is important to career success; while white women are more concerned with the importance of childcare policy. Regarding effectiveness of work-life policies, with the exception of childcare policy, the faculty groups do not differ significantly. Significant group differences emerge in faculty assessment of childcare policy with the largest proportion of white women dissatisfied with its effectiveness on their campuses. Finally, African American men are the most satisfied with their work-life balance. Second, in contrast to my hypothesis, the analysis reveals institutional-level support for care work influences overall satisfaction with the institution more so than departmental support. Also, women are more satisfied than men, and being married has a negative effect on satisfaction. The findings suggest care work still matters in relation to a faculty member&apos;s career advancement. Institutions should create clear guidelines regarding policy use related to caregiving activities. These guidelines should encourage both men and women to use these policies for activities not related to childcare but also for broader care issues. Creating an automatic &quot;opt-in&quot; policy could assist in transforming a culture that has historically had a bias in using family policy. Further, race and gender must be considered when constructing policies to address career balance concerns. Not all policies affect people the same way, and depending on what type of care, child or elder, the challenges will be unique to the social location of the faculty member.

				"dc:description" : "Organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) is a social science construct defined by Organ (1988) as employee actions that are discretionary, not formally recognized or rewarded, and that are helpful to the effectiveness of the organization. This study explored part-time work as a base of OCB by investigating the relationship between this construct and organizational sense of belonging (OSB) as proffered by Quinn (2006) and Merriman (2010) among adjunct faculty at a two-year, Midwestern technical college. Teaching faculty, both full-time and adjunct, were sent an email explaining the study and containing an embedded hyperlink connecting them to an electronic survey. The instrument used to measure OCB was created by Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Moorman and Fetter (1990). Somers&apos; (1999) BESR work/school subscale assessed OSB. There were 92 full-time and 77 adjunct faculty who participated in this study. Three research questions were examined and eight associated hypotheses tested. There was a statistically significant difference in the degree of OSB measured among full-time faculty when compared to the degree of OSB measured among adjunct faculty. The results of a two-tailed difference of means t-test accepted hypothesis one, t(100.15) = 2.31, p = 0.023, alpha = 0.05. This was an expected outcome as they have committed to make teaching their full-time occupation at this institution, and have greater opportunities to create and maintain connections with other employees that enhance their OSB (Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995). There was not a statistically significant difference in the degree of OCB measured among full-time faculty when compared to the degree of OCB measured among adjunct faculty. The results of a two-tailed difference of means t-test rejected hypothesis two, t(101.27) = 0.36, p = 0.723, alpha = 0.05. These results suggest that OCB can not necessarily be attributed solely to full-time workers; part-time employees have been shown to be equally likely to engage in OCB. This was an unexpected finding. However, since the mean scores of both groups are relatively high (M = 5.92 for full-time faculty and M = 5.85 for adjuncts on a scale of 1.0 to 7.0), it could be concluded that the faculty at the institution in this study exhibit a strong degree of extra-role behavior, regardless of employee class. Simple linear regression was utilized to analyze hypothesis three through eight, testing the model OCB = ß[subscript 0] + ß[subscript1](OSB) where OSB was the predictor variable for the criterion variable OCB (or one of the five dimensions of OCB) as proffered by Organ (1988). OSB was found to be a statistically significant linear predictor of the general OCB construct (F(1) = 29.57, p &lt; 0.001, alpha = 0.05), and was found to be a significant linear predictor of the following dimensions of OCB: altruism (F[1] = 36.45, p &lt; 0.001, alpha = 0.05), conscientiousness (F[1] = 8.51, p = 0.005, alpha = 0.05), and civic virtue (F[1] = 16.70, p &lt; 0.001, alpha = 0.05). Since OCB is inherently beneficial and the hiring of these part-time workers has increased over the last few decades, it is fitting for college administrators to find ways to help them make connections at their institutions (Lee &amp; Robbins, 1995; Quinn, 2006).

				"dc:description" : "This dissertation describes and analyzes the academic language socialization of culturally and linguistically diverse adolescents through a multi-case ethnographic study of high school writing instruction in California. I argue that there is a significant gap between the norms for writing in English language development classes and those in the mainstream college prep English classes into which students transition, especially with respect to students&apos; access to academic language and development of independence as writers. I observed and recorded classroom talk about writing over one academic year in two English language development classes (Transitions to English) and one mainstream English language arts class (Senior Literature and Composition). Follow-up interviews with graduated seniors considered their transition into college writing. Data were analyzed using a grounded theory approach (Strauss, 1987). Further deductive analyses consider classroom discourse patterns (Bloome &quot;et al.&quot;, 2005; Gibbons, 2006) in order to identify patterns and particularities in teacher responses to student writing. Findings suggest that multilingual students&apos; language learning experiences in Transitions were not socializing them to be fully competent or proficient members of the Senior Lit classroom. Rather, the contradicting norms for writing created a gap for multilingual students between their opportunities to learn academic language in Transitions and the ways they were expected to use academic language in writing for Senior Lit. Language socialization in both Transitions and mainstream classes was only partial: the students learned academic content through language, but did not learn new language that they needed to develop stronger understanding of the content or an ability to express that content independently. Teachers&apos; beliefs about curricular requirements and students&apos; academic proficiency played a central role in the language and writing socialization of their students; data about these beliefs helped to explain the gap between concepts of writing and language taught in Transitions and Senior Lit. Graduated seniors reported varied feelings of readiness for college writing: the multilingual graduates all placed into some form of developmental or support composition classes in their first semester of college. Implications of this study recommend that teacher education and professional development must address the language socialization needs of diverse student populations. Further implications address the need for state and local policy that supports more coherent writing curriculum for all students and for further research into adolescent academic language socialization.

				"dc:description" : "The purpose for conducting this study was to investigate and describe the relationship between applicant criteria for a dental hygiene program and subsequent outcomes on credentialing exams: the National Board Dental Hygiene Exam and the Southern Regional Testing Agency clinical exam. Because admission criteria play a crucial role in applicant selection, choosing students, that will successfully complete the program as well as the necessary credentialing exams, is a particularly crucial task for admission committees. The study had three elements. First, it investigated the relationship between the variables of age, undergraduate GPA and scores from the Psychological Services Bureau Health Occupations Aptitude Examination (PSB) and successful student performance on the NBDHE and a regional clinical exam, namely the Southern Regional Testing Agency. Second, it investigated the validity of the predictive value of the PSB entrance exam as one of the admission criteria for the selected program. Third, it investigated the strength of the relationship of age, undergraduate GPA, and PSB scores as a predictor of program completion and subsequent success on credentialing licensure exams. This study analyzed secondary data from an accredited dental hygiene program that awards an Associate's of Applied Science Degree in the mid-south United States. The results revealed a weak, if any, correlation between the candidate selection criteria and the subsequent outcomes on post-graduate credentialing exams. Age was a negative weak correlation, if any, for the dependent variable NBDHE with a Pearson Correlation value of r = -0.037 for the NBDHE and r = -0.142 for the SRTA clinical exam. Undergraduate GPA revealed a weak relationship to NBDHE scores with a Pearson Correlation of r = 0.312 and a negative weak relationship, if any, to the SRTA clinical exam scores with a Pearson Correlation of r = -0.050. The PSB score was a moderate predictor for NBDHE scores with a Pearson Correlation of r = 0.364. The PSB score however, was a negative weak predictor of SRTA clinical exam scores with a Pearson Correlation of r = -0.134.

This study sought to identify differences in the presence and impact of three research-based district-reform factors: the district instructional vision, the commitment and capacity to enact the vision, and the use of a multi-level data system as a means of providing feedback on progress towards the vision. Additionally, the study sought to identify differences in perceived impact on site leadership capacity and teacher self-efficacy and job satisfaction. An exploratory comparative case study methodology was employed using an online survey and semi-structured interviews to collect and analyze data on eighteen variables. Two California unified school districts were compared based on differences in district-wide student improvement rates on annual testing. An exploratory factor analysis identified a set of empirically-based factors consisting of district-based initiative and actions, site-based instructional decision making and, site leadership associated with the survey providing an alternate perspective to organize data while offering an additional lens to consider the impact of the research-based factors. Total population and two within-group samples were compared between districts. Findings surfaced differences in perceptions and actions of district-wide staff associated with district vision, commitment and capacity building, data use, and site leadership variables. No differences were found in the presence of teacher self-efficacy and job satisfaction between the two districts. While limited in their generalizability, the results appear to point out the influence of a district instructional vision on district commitment, professional development, and site leadership. Topics for further research include the impact of district instructional vision on high school reform efforts, on large urban school districts, and influences of the school district community in establishing and maintaining an instructional vision. The study concludes by offering implications for practice associated with district-wide student outcome improvements.

				"dc:description" : "Many theories, methods, and practices are utilized to evaluate teachers with the intention of determining teacher effectiveness to better inform decisions about retention, tenure, certification and performance-based pay. In the 21st century there has been a renewed emphasis on teacher evaluation in public schools, largely due to federal &quot;Race to the Top&quot; funding and the emergence of value-added models for determining teacher performance in relation to student achievement. Bearing that in mind, this study was designed to address the question: Where are the consistency and differentiation among criteria used to measure teacher effectiveness ratings when a 21st century, Race to the Top driven, standards- and teacher-effects-based model (Danielson and McGreal, 2000; Stake, 2006) is compared to a traditional, objectives-based model (Tyler, 1940), using the same population over a single school year, while also using different evaluators for each model? An answer proved to be elusive because almost no variation was discovered in the traditional model data, while no variation was discovered in the 21st century model data. A strong proportion (0.99) of selected scores in both models was discovered, but the lack of variance across all scores limits generalizability to a larger population. The proportion indicates that for the population in this study (n = 80), despite the additional time needed to implement the 21st century model and its higher ordinal scaling, the 21 st century model did not meet its primary goal of better recognizing effective teaching than the traditional model. Changes to the structure and/or implementation may be required for the 21st century model, so that more dispersion can be identified and reported, which will theoretically better inform decisions about retention, tenure, certification and performance-based pay.

				"dc:description" : "The development of preservice teacher beliefs is a complicated, non-linear process. It has been suggested that preservice teacher beliefs are highly impacted by their past histories as students, and that these beliefs act as a filter for interpreting the coursework and ideas in their teacher education programs. Understanding the way preservice teachers form beliefs can give insight into the choices teachers enact in practice. This dissertation considers the processes by which a cohort of 12 preservice English teachers formed beliefs about literacy, teaching, and learning in a 13-month professional program. The study traces the belief development of the research participants and identifies opportunities within the teacher education program that promoted nuances in perspectives related to literacy, teaching, and learning. Grounded theory was used to code and interpret the ethnographic data collected in six courses. Data included in-class discourse, reflective writing, online forum posts, and high stakes writing assignments staggered throughout the program. Analysis of this data indicated that when candidates integrated experiential evidencing and theoretical referencing into their written and spoken discourse, their beliefs were more nuanced. The findings also indicated that while candidates entered with pre-existing beliefs, these beliefs did not necessarily change, but instead developed within given contexts. This study therefore suggests a fresh way of framing forthcoming research on teacher beliefs, not as constructs that are static or in need of changing, but instead as resources that candidates draw from in relation to certain contexts and opportunities.

				"dc:description" : "Many students enter institutions of higher education underprepared for college level coursework. Instructors must establish early connections with these students to engage them in their required coursework and foster success in remedial coursework. The purpose of this descriptive, quantitative study was to examine the sensory processing preferences of community college developmental math instructors and students enrolled in remedial math as a means to gain insights into the potential role of sensory preferences in student engagement, academic achievement, and plan for persistence. The framework of this study was a combination of theory related to sensory processing and current research in the area of student engagement and persistence in order to determine if similarities between sensory profiles of instructors and those of students positively impact student engagement, academic achievement, and plan for persistence. Instructors and students were grouped based on similar (SSP) and dissimilar (DSP) Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profiles. Degree of student engagement and plan for persistence identified by the CLASSE-Student survey and final course grades were compared between the two groups using independent t tests for each dependent variable. Data analysis revealed that plan for persistence between the two groups was statistically significant; suggesting that degree of similarity of the instructor and student sensory profiles may impact a student&apos;s plan to enroll in a course the next semester. Implications for social change include using findings in training for remedial math instructors to provide them greater insight into the role of sensory preferences as a predictor for plan for persistence of students requiring remedial math education.

				"dc:description" : "This study analyzed how Wisconsin rural public high schools' academic achievement compared to their city, suburb and town peers while controlling for ten factors. The Wisconsin Knowledge and Concepts Examination (WKCE) measured academic achievement for tenth graders including reading, language arts, mathematics, science and social studies. The ten independent variables included geographic location, socioeconomic status, students of color, spending per pupil in the school district, high school enrollment, parent education level, truancy, disciplinary actions: suspensions and expulsions, students with disabilities and extra/co-curricular activity participation. Data were provided by state and federal public databases. Findings indicated that rural high schools in the state of Wisconsin performed as well as town and city high schools and in some subject areas as well as suburban high schools. Further, the data suggest that there are serious academic performance concerns for students and schools with certain demographics and that those problems need to be addressed immediately and effectively. Findings from this study suggest that the argument to consolidate rural high schools because of poor academic performance is not a valid one. All high schools in Wisconsin including rural high schools should be supported by policy makers and practitioners to ensure high academic achievement opportunities for all.

It helps to clarify the questions that each model answers best, as well as the limitations of each model. This document is intended to support states as they address the challenges of evolving assessment and accountability systems. This guide does not promote one type of interpretation over another. Rather, it describes growth models in terms of the interpretations they best support and, in turn, the questions they are best designed to answer. The goal of this guide is thus to increase alignment between user interpretations and model function in order for models to best serve their desired purposes: increasing student achievement, decreasing achievement gaps, and improving the effectiveness of educators and schools. The report is divided into two parts. Part I, A Framework for Operational Growth Models, includes seven models: (1) Growth and Growth Models; (2) Growth: Beyond Status; (3) Different Ways to Slice the Data: Status, Improvement, and Growth; (4) What is a Growth Model?; (5) Growth Models of Interest; (6) Critical Questions for Describing Growth Models; and (7) Alternative Growth Model Classification Schemes. Part II, The Growth Models, includes seven chapters: 1: The Gain Score Model; (2) The Trajectory Model; (3) The Categorical Model; (4) The Residual Gain Model; (5) The Projection Model; (6) The Student Growth Percentile Model; and (7) The Multivariate Model. An appendix explains cross-referencing growth model terms. A bibliography is also included.",

				"dc:description" : "Community colleges in the United States have long been known as institutions of equal opportunity and affordable education. One facet of student life appearing at more and more community colleges is the addition of residence halls. Still, the number of community colleges with on-campus living is relatively small, and for the campuses with residence halls, one common, recurring assumption is made regarding a lack of discipline within the living facilities. This endeavor can be an expensive venture, especially for a community college that may not have the resources or funds to take a substantial financial risk. The administration of a community college needs ample justification and support to get a project of this magnitude approved by the governing board. One important piece of justification and support an institution must be prepared to provide is a thorough residence hall disciplinary code. Such a code would reduce the primary concern that mischief and distractions within the halls could detract from the educational mission of the college. This report analyzed five Missouri Community College residence hall disciplinary codes and compared to recommended codes in residence hall literature and best practices. A set of criteria was developed and the Council for the Advancement of Standards in Higher Education was used as a guide in order to make a recommendation. The recommendation of this research is to use the key criteria when building a residence hall discipline code but to remember the regional issues each college may face. A standard template for residence hall codes should be developed statewide in order to provide consistency and legal structure while still being flexible enough to adapt to specific college needs.

				"dc:description" : "This research study focused on the perceptions of challenges and values of higher education between first-generation and subsequent-generation male Latinos and their factors affecting academic success. According to Gandara (2009), Latinas are making advancements in higher education, being committed to continue with college, and maintaining higher academic grade attainment. However, Latinos have not succeeded at the same rate as Latinas and continue to struggle academically in high school and in college (Gandara, 2009). Therefore, it is important to understand and address the latest demographic challenges that confront Latinos. Specifically, it is important to note the challenges Latino students face at this large, urban community college located in Central California categorized as (a) institutional, (b) individual, and (c) environmental. Data for this study were collected on male Latino student (N = 112) undergraduates who participated in the study; there were three generations. These three focus groups consisted of the following: 1st-, 2nd-and 3rd-or-later-generation Latino students. These data were collected at this large, urban community college located in Central California. A series of questions on the attitudes of Latinos toward education were examined, the parents' level of participation in their children's education was determined, their perceptions of challenges to participation were assessed, and their definition of participation was addressed. A regression model was chosen for the analysis. The regression analysis appeared to be the most appropriate method used in this examination because there was one dependent variable (perceptions on values of higher education) and three independent variables (generation, age, and marital status) were assumed as interval scale. The results of this analysis demonstrated that Latino students did not change that much by generation in their perception of the importance of education. One of the main reasons the researcher did not find much differences between the generations might have been that the survey sample was too small and was not representative. It is also essential to understand whether other factors, such as 1st or 2nd-generation-related factors, played a significant role in preventing Latinos from attending higher education. Therefore, it is important to understand and address the latest demographic challenges that confront Latinos, such as limited individual support and academic preparation, institutional problems with articulation, and environmental oppositions.

				"dc:description" : "Currently, two-year colleges are teaching the lion&apos;s share of college composition classes, mainly consisting of developmental writing and first-year composition courses; however, those same two-year colleges have been slow in embracing the composition theory and practices that are studied and implemented at four-year colleges. One way to disseminate a compositionally-centered agenda throughout two-year colleges is through strong leadership. Using principles of organizational learning and leadership, this research explored the impact of English department chairs&apos; educational backgrounds on their departments. A mixed method approach was used to examine the two selected department chairs. One department chair, from college A (AC), has a Ph.D. in composition while the other, from C College (CC), has a traditional masters degree in English. Existing organizational learning surveys were adapted to better fit English department concerns, and they were administered to both sets of English faculty, both full-time and part-time members. Once the surveys were completed and calculated, each department chair was interviewed as a way to triangulate the survey data and flesh out each department chair&apos;s departmental vision. 90 of the 159 surveys (56.6%) were completed in total between the two colleges, and each department chair interview lasted roughly 80 minutes. After analyzing both sets of data, it was found that both colleges show evidence of organizational learning; nevertheless, the department chairs articulated significantly different organizational intentions. The department chairs&apos; differing intentions and their impacts on their departments were analyzed and seen to impact faculty interaction, faculty&apos;s perception of their position, and departmental hiring practices. Due to these ramifications of department chair vision, the study asserts two-year college English departments would be better served if led by strong compositionally-focused leaders.

The Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems (SLDS) Grant Program was asked by several states to review current growth models with the goal of determining the impact of different models on longitudinal data systems and capturing some best practices that states are using in the implementation process. From July 2011 through February 2012, representatives from Colorado, Arkansas, Ohio, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Florida participated in a working group session and follow-up discussions facilitated by members of the State Support Team (SST). This working group allowed states to more easily discuss and share strategies, best practices, and challenges related to the use of growth models. Specifically, these states have provided the following information to the SST in response to questions about their specific growth model(s) related to: (1) types and purposes of growth model(s) used; (2) description of model(s) used; (3) data elements required for each model; and (4) issues and barriers experienced during development, implementation, or use.",

				"dc:description" : "Beginning with the No Child Left Behind federal legislation, states were required to use data to monitor and improve student achievement. For high schools, the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education chose End of Course Exams (EOC) to demonstrate levels of student achievement. The policy changed from school choice of paper-pencil or computer-based testing to mandated computer-based testing. This study examined whether this decision best demonstrates the level of student mastery. Using high school EOC test scores for United States Government exams as the independent variable and high school cumulative grade point average (CGPA) as the dependent variable, the study examined the correlation between CGPA and computer-based (CBT) versus paper-pencil (PPT) modes of testing. Random samples from two comparable school districts were used to provide data. School A tested using computers, while school B used paper-pencil testing. Data presented in this study demonstrate there is little relationship between CGPA and EOC scores depending upon the mode of test administration. For the most part, the null hypotheses were not rejected. Results indicated limited support in some subgroups for the alternative hypotheses that students with a 2.5 or higher cumulative grade point average will score higher on end of course paper-pencil tests, while students with less than a 2.5 cumulative grade point average will score higher on end of course computer-based tests. Results of this study call into question whether the state and school districts should allow students choice of test mode or perhaps even require students to take the test using the mode of administration their cumulative grade point average indicates would demonstrate their actual level of achievement. This study also questions whether other high stakes tests such as the ACT, SAT, TOEFL, and LSAT, should determine mode of administration based on students' CGPA. Finally with the push for data driven classroom curriculum assessment, should the results of this study be applied to the need for differentiation in the classroom with regard to assessments.

				"dc:description" : "The purpose of this study was to explore the codependencies of the social and technical structures that yield Wikipedia the website and Wikipedia the community. In doing so, the research investigated the implications of such a sociotechnical system for the maintenance of the project and the emergence of collective intelligence. Using a theoretical framework informed by digital media studies, science and technology studies, and the political economy of communication, this study examined the material and ideological conditions in which Wikipedia has developed. The study&apos;s guiding research questions addressed the nature of Wikipedia&apos;s sociotechnical system and potential for collective intelligence, as well as the historical development of the project&apos;s technical infrastructure and the state of its technology-assisted collaboration. A mainly qualitative multi-method research approach was employed, including document analysis, semi-structured interviewing, and social network analysis. A plethora of documents were carefully selected and examined to explore how and why decisions were made, policies implemented, and technologies adopted on the site. Additionally, 45 interviews were conducted with members of Wikipedia&apos;s technical community to understand the relationships between social and technical aspects of the project and the motivations of programmers who contribute automated tools. Finally, social network measures and visualizations were used to interrogate notions of collaboration and make more transparent the centrality of technology to the content creation process. The study revealed that Wikipedia&apos;s technical development has been shaped by the dueling ideologies of the open-source software movement and postindustrial capitalism. Its sociotechnical system features the complex collaboration of human contributors, automated programs, social bureaucracy, and technical protocol, each of which conditions the existence and meaning of the others. In addition, the activity on Wikipedia fits established models of collective intelligence and suggests the emergence of a cyberculture, or culturally informed shared intelligence, unique to the digital media context. Software robots (bots) are central actors in this system and are explored in detail throughout this research.

				"dc:description" : "In order for simulations and games to be effective for learning, instructional designers must verify that the underlying computational models being used have an appropriate degree of fidelity to the conceptual models of their real-world counterparts. A simulation/game that provides incorrect feedback is likely to promote misunderstanding and adversely affect learning and transfer. Numerous methods for verifying the accuracy of a computational model exist, but it is generally accepted that no single method is adequate and that multiple methods should be used. The purpose of this study was to propose and test a new method for collecting and analyzing users&apos; interaction data (e.g., choices made, actions taken, results and feedback obtained) to provide quantified evidence that the underlying computational model of a simulation/game represents the conceptual model with sufficient accuracy. In this study, analysis of patterns in time (APT) was used to compare gameplay results from the Diffusion Simulation Game (DSG) with predictions based on diffusion of innovations theory (DOI). A program was written to automatically play the DSG by analyzing the game state during each turn, seeking patterns of game component attributes that matched optimal strategies based on DOI theory. When the use of optimal strategies did not result in the desired number of successful games, here defined as the threshold of confidence for model verification, further investigation revealed flaws in the computational model. These flaws were incrementally corrected and subsequent gameplay results were analyzed until the threshold of confidence was achieved. In addition to analysis of patterns in time for model verification (APTMV), other verification methods used included code walkthrough, execution tracing, desk checking, syntax checking, and statistical analysis. The APTMV method was found to be complementary to these other methods, providing quantified evidence of the computational model&apos;s degree of accuracy and pinpointing flaws that could be corrected to improve fidelity. The APTMV approach to verification and improvement of computational models is described and compared with other methods, and improvements to the process are proposed.

The purpose of this qualitative case study was to examine teachers&apos; perceptions of their first teaching positions to determine whether they felt that there is a need for more undergraduate preparation and/or more support from school district administrators. Vygotsky&apos;s zone of proximal development and Piaget&apos;s constructivist theory provided the framework for this research. Qualitative data were gathered from first-year teachers being interviewed or answering a questionnaire. Interviews and questionnaires were subsequently coded using a topical analysis. Results suggested 5 areas in which first-year teachers felt they needed more support or preparation, which included more support from school districts and administrators, preparation in meeting the needs of diverse students, lack of undergraduate preparation, lack of classroom management skills, and more support from mentors. Upon completion of the qualitative study, a detailed program was presented to local colleges, universities, and school districts in order to increase awareness on the evidence-based ways in which first-year teachers can better be supported in order to retain them. This study can lead to positive social change by helping teachers, school administrators, and university professors develop training to ensure that first-year teachers feel well prepared to offer a high-quality education to all students.

				"dc:description" : "Research reveals that many teachers express a discomfort about teaching writing; moreover, there is growing evidence that professional learning communities can have a positive impact on teacher learning and performance. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore the relationship between teachers&apos; involvement in a professional learning community and their attitudes toward writing instruction. Research questions for this study were designed to uncover how involvement in a professional learning community may have influenced teachers&apos; attitudes and feelings of efficacy toward writing instruction. Using a constructivist approach, qualitative data were gathered through focus groups, interviews, field notes, and classroom observations of six elementary school writing teachers who had been involved in professional learning. Data analysis included the process of classifying and interpreting themes which were described using thick, rich descriptions. The most significant themes to emerge included the following: collaboration with peers, participation in writing workshops, interaction with instructional coaches, and student achievement. Using these themes to plan professional learning activities could help teachers gain efficacy with writing instruction. Moreover, knowing more about how educators develop as writing teachers could, in turn, lead to schools that produce a society of more effective writers. Effective writers may become accomplished citizens with greater employment opportunities. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

				"dc:description" : "Improving college performance and retention is a daunting task for colleges and universities. Many institutions are taking action to increase retention rates by exploring their academic programs. Regression analysis was used to compare the effectiveness of ACT mathematics scores, high school grade point averages (HSGPA), and demographic factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic status for predicting final grades in students' first mathematics courses at Spring Hill College. The results of this study were examined to validate whether the current system for placing students in first-year mathematics courses is successful. Data was used from 870 student records for the freshman fall cohorts from 2008 to 2010. Students were enrolled in Intermediate Algebra, Precalculus, or Calculus I. The results of the study indicate that ACT mathematics score, HSGPA, age, and gender were all statistically significant predictors of students' grades in their first-year mathematics courses with HSGPA the best predictor of all. It was recommended that admission counselors and mathematics department faculty place students in freshmen mathematics courses based on HSGPA, ACT mathematics scores, and the number of mathematics courses taken in high school but with a much stronger emphasis on HSGPA.

				"dc:description" : "Social challenges tear at the fabric of the African American family, revealing complexities that identify a de facto leader, the African American woman. She exists in a chasm of overt circumstances which heavily influences her successes. The purpose of this study is to identify factors that motivated seven female African American community college graduates to persist throughout crisis and to ultimately reach their academic goals and graduate. Using a qualitative narrative design, the study involved semi structured interviews with seven African American women who employed community colleges and other support strategies to accomplish appropriate responses to crises, identify practical support mechanisms, and achieve professional advancement in order to attain professional success. Findings provide a clearer picture of the elements these participants feel foster and enhance their abilities to stay enrolled, to persist and to graduate from college. The study findings illustrate the importance students place on their family&apos;s support, the support of their faith and the support of college faculty and staff. The Bates Model for the Initial Creation of a Community College Counseling/Crisis Intervention Center is presented to foster the development of a support service center which will allow community colleges to better meet the needs of these non-traditional students.

				"dc:description" : "This research study examines the role of digital media, more specifically online forums, in the development of academic literacy and language learning in English as a Second Language (ESL) college writing. Studies in Second Language Acquisition suggest that participation in online forum discussions can potentially foster collaboration, self-expression, and active involvement, affording students with a learning environment that encourages critical thinking and problem-solving. Accordingly, online forum discussions used as educational environments can also become a powerful vehicle to support academic literacy development. In this context, this research study aims to provide a careful analysis of student participation in digital practices of literacy engaged through online forums in a college-level ESL class in order to understand what ESL students accomplish discursively when expressing and disputing opinions in an online forum discussion. Analysis will include: 1) detailed descriptive analysis of online forum discussions as forms of engagement in practices of digital literacy, with particular attention to the differences between online forum discussions as &quot;everyday practices,&quot; engaged outside of school settings, and online forum discussions as &quot;pedagogical practice,&quot; engaged in a college-level ESL writing class; 2) careful examination of the discourse of the contributions ESL students wrote in online forums with particular attention to viewing ESL students as multilingual individuals, creating language through expressing and disputing opinions in online forum discussions; 3) thoughtful consideration of the relationship between writing in online forum discussions and writing academic persuasive essays. As a consequence of this study, pedagogical uses and implications for teaching with digital literacies will also be investigated through critical examination of the design and application of online forum discussions in language learning and literacy educational practices.

				"dc:description" : "The Wyoming Department of Education (WDE) has invested time and money developing standardized achievement test score reports designed to give teachers data about each of their students' levels of mastery of particular concepts in order to differentiate their instruction. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which eighth-grade mathematics teachers used Traffic Signal Project Reports to analyze how teachers used data to differentiate instruction. A qualitative case study methodology was used in gathering data from teachers of similar backgrounds and school settings. This study focused on three research questions including how teachers used Traffic Signal Project Reports to inform their instruction, how teachers differentiated their instruction based on assessment data, and how teachers decided which sources of data they used to make instructional changes in the classroom. A panel of experts, seventh- and eighth-grade Wyoming math teachers, analyzed a set of interview questions and determined that they were adequate for the purpose of the case study. Questions focused on whether teachers used Traffic Signal Project Reports and/or other types of data to shape their instruction. The population of this study was middle school mathematics teachers located in Wyoming. Ten eighth-grade mathematics teachers from Title I schools and schools with similar demographics participated in the study. Results from the study showed that standardized test score data were used mostly for grouping students in classes by ability rather than used for differentiating instruction within the classroom. Also, teachers were more comfortable using their own classroom data pieces to differentiate instruction in the classroom rather than standardized achievement test score data. Furthermore, teachers utilized various forms of data to make instructional decisions such as class groupings or adjusting curriculum. The majority of the teachers either implied or stressed the need to utilize multiple sources of data before making instructional decisions. The teachers also indicated that the Traffic Signal Project Reports should be modified to make them more user-friendly for differentiation.

				"dc:description" : "Nursing educators have been encouraged to engage in the scholarship of teaching as a form of best practice in education. Despite professional documents and encouragement by leaders in the field of nursing, there is very little known about nursing educators&apos; perceptions and engagement in the scholarship of teaching. The purpose of this phenomenological qualitative study was to understand the perceptions nursing educators had regarding research activities related to the scholarship of teaching. These activities included reading educational research, encouraging others to read educational research, applying educational research to teaching practice, conducting, and disseminating educational research. The study was based on the theories of constructivism and diffusion of innovation. A sample of six nursing educators were interviewed regarding their perceptions about the scholarship of teaching as part of the faculty role, perceptions of their ability to perform, and current participation in the research related activities. The findings indicated nursing educators understood the definition of scholarship of teaching, the importance of using evidence-based teaching methods, and desired to incorporate the scholarly activities into their classrooms. The participants indicated that the research related activities, especially conducting and disseminating educational research, were difficult to perform. Reasons given for the difficulty in performance included lack of time, lack of formal pedagogy training, and lack of administrative support. The implications of these findings offer nursing faculty ideas on how to incorporate the scholarship of teaching into their everyday lesson plans and course curriculums. The findings also indicated continuing education is needed for educators on nursing education pedagogy and evidence-based teaching methods. However, for nursing education to improve there needs to be cooperation between administration and the nursing educators. Additional research is needed comparing the perceptions of educators who actively engage in the scholarship of teaching to educators who do not. What are the differences and what are the similarities in the way these different groups conduct their classrooms?

				"dc:description" : "Despite comprising only a small fraction of all vocational education and training (VET) in Schools enrolments, programs that count towards both national VET qualifications and university entry potentially fill an important role in the upper-secondary school curriculum. The aim of this study is to take a first step in gaining an understanding of the efficacy of VET in Schools courses by estimating the relationship between enrolling in Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) VET subjects and university access. The authors chose to examine the outcomes from VCE VET courses because they represent a model of assessment, known as &quot;scored VET&quot;, that closely resembles that applied in general courses. In particular, the assessment involves both written exams and numerical assessment of performance in job-specific tasks associated with units of competency. In this study, the analysis is carried out on a sample of school completers in Victoria in 2011 who lodged a first preference for enrolment in a university course prior to sitting their final year exams. To meet the aim of this study, the following key research questions are addressed: (1) What is the relationship between taking a Victorian Certificate of Education VET subject and university entry scores?; (2) To what extent is any relationship explained by scores in VCE VET subjects (direct effect) as opposed to scores in all other subjects taken by VCE VET students (indirect effect)?; (3) Does any relationship depend upon the type of VCE VET subject chosen?; (4) What is the relationship between participating in VCE VET subjects and the chances of being offered a place at university?; and (5) What is the relationship between participating in VCE VET subjects and the chances of attaining a first, third or sixth university entry preference? It was found that among students who intend to go to university, controlling for a range of differences between those who do and who do not take a VCE VET subject, that those who take a VCE VET subject have a six-point lower score on average than those who do not take a VCE VET subject (111 compared with 117 out of a possible 205). This represents around a 5% lower university entry score on average and is robust to the range of alternative key assumptions that underpin the analysis. Across VCE VET subject groupings, the authors found some variation in magnitude of the estimated negative association, with significant negative associations found in four of the seven subject groupings (engineering and technology; community, outdoor and recreation; hospitality; information technology) and no statistically significant negative results found for the rest (business and finance; dance and music; equine industry). Importantly, the authors stress that this study only examines the impacts of taking VCE VET subjects on direct access to university. Other important outcomes from VCE VET programs, such as indirect access to university (for example, by completing a diploma course), participation in post-school VET study, retention in post-school study, and employment outcomes are not investigated here, but should be considered in any overall evaluation of these programs. The following are appended: (1) Assessment; (2) VCE VET subjects; (3) Technical appendix; (4) Probit results and balancing test results; and (5) Sensitivity analysis.",

				"dc:description" : "Many researchers have documented the challenges of working with culturally different elementary and high school students and have provided evidence of pedagogical practices that increase student engagement and academic success. However, a gap still exists in the understanding of student engagement and academic success of adult refugee students in higher education. Teaching methods, institutional and classroom environments, and educational policies may change through student voice. This case study used the theoretical framework of culturally relevant pedagogy to explore how Iraqi refugee students, enrolled in a community college, defined academic success, described their optimal learning environment, and remained engaged in college despite cultural differences. Purposeful and snowball sampling were used to select the 8 participants and data were collected through one-on-one interviews using open ended questions. Data were coded and analyzed using Atlas.ti to identify themes within and across cases. Results supported the academic success component of culturally relevant pedagogy; however, participants gave insight into barriers to success, offered solutions to eliminate those barriers, and implied that enhancing cultural competence within the college would increase student engagement and assist in acculturation. These findings led to the development of a specialized orientation designed to accommodate those needs. Recommendations include the implementation of specialized orientation programs to support culturally diverse students. Knowledge gained through this research encourages positive social change to embrace diversity and help newcomers establish themselves as they adapt to the local community and American educational systems.

				"dc:description" : "The standards-based reform movement has resulted in the wide-spread use of summative assessments designed to measure students&apos; performance at specific points in time. While many have hoped that these end-of-year tests would provide constructional useful information for educators, they do not. This is not because there is something &quot;wrong&quot; with these summative accountability tests, rather that they were not designed to meet instructional purposes. Recognizing the inherent limitations of summative assessment, educators are looking for additional assessments to inform and track student learning during the year. Large numbers of vendors are now selling what they call &quot;benchmark,&quot; &quot;diagnostic,&quot; and/or &quot;predictive&quot; assessments with promises of improving student performance. These systems often lay claim to the research documenting the powerful effect of formative assessment on student learning. However, the research in this area, including the seminal Black and Wiliam (1998) meta-analysis, evaluated formative assessments of a very different character than essentially all current commercially-available interim assessment programs. This policy brief provides a definition to differentiate between true classroom formative assessment and the interim assessments currently in the marketplace. It also describes a framework for understanding what purposes interim assessments can serve and considering their appropriate role in a comprehensive assessment system. The goal of this brief is to help district leaders thoughtfully examine the commercially-available interim assessment products, develop strong specifications for a customized system, develop their own interim assessments, or determine that interim assessments are not an appropriate tool for their assessment system. A second goal is to help state leaders consider what role they might play in supporting effective interim assessment practices. This policy brief is organized into the following seven sections: (1) Distinguishing among Assessment Types; (2) Questions to Start With; (3) Determining the Purpose for the Interim Assessment; (4) Characteristics of an Effective Interim Assessment System to Be Used for Instructional Purposes; (5) Current Commercially Available Interim Assessment Systems; (6) Implications for District and State Decision Makers; and (7) Conclusions.",

				"dc:description" : "There is very little evidence regarding the specifics of how teacher candidates in preservice teacher education programs employing a cohort system interact and support one another. Similarly, there have been calls for more evidence of the specifics of the socialization process of teacher candidates, especially as it relates to the relationship between program design and peer interaction and support within a cohort. Utilizing a situated learning perspective and ethnographic tools (Green, Dixon &amp; Zaharlick, 2002), observations and interviews were conducted of teacher candidates and their instructors and supervisors, both at the university and in the partner schools, over the course of a full academic year. Using the full year of field experience as a lens for the analysis, a recursive relationship between teacher education program design, peer interaction and support and the socialization process was found. The willingness and ability of the teacher candidates to support and learn from one another was facilitated by certain elements of program design. First, the number and variety of cross-disciplinary, mini-cohorts the program placed them in over the course of the year put them in close proximity to a large number of their peers, exposing them to a wide range of expertise. Second, the safe spaces created for them by clinical faculty at the partner schools and by program administration and faculty at the university enabled them to discuss, reflect, and problem-solve openly. Finally, the program design gave teacher candidates multiple support options throughout the year, rather than just one cooperating teacher, and the evidence showed that the teacher candidates explored those multiple options. The findings point to the cohort system as a design that can facilitate peer interaction and support. For programs that do not employ a cohort system, the findings indicate that peer interaction and support is likely to result from encouraging collaboration and communication across disciplines. The need for teacher candidates to be socialized into school cultures by mentors familiar with the particulars of the school and placed in mini-cohorts to share their experiences is also a finding that cuts across all teacher education programs.

				"dc:description" : "A state selected at random from the Hilbert space of a many-body system is overwhelmingly likely to exhibit highly non-classical correlations. For these typical states, half of the environment must be measured by an observer to determine the state of a given subsystem. The objectivity of classical reality--the fact that multiple observers can each agree on the state of a subsystem after measuring just a small fraction of its environment--implies that the correlations found in nature between macroscopic systems and their environments are very exceptional. This is understood through the redundant recording of information about the preferred states of a decohering system by its environment, a phenomenon known as quantum Darwinism. To see this in action in the real world, we first consider the ubiquitous case of blackbody illumination. We show that it exhibits fast and extensive proliferation of information about an object into the environment, yielding redundancies orders of magnitude larger than the exactly soluble models considered previously. Turning to a universe of qubits, we examine the conditions needed for the creation of branching states and study their demise through many-body interactions. We show that even constrained dynamics can suppress redundancies to the values typical of random states on relaxation timescales, and prove that these results hold exactly in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we connect these ideas to the consistent histories framework. Building on the criterion of partial-trace consistency, we introduce a sensible notion of mutual information between a fragment of the universe and a history itself.

				"dc:description" : "The nation is showing an unprecedented focus on increasing the rigor in education and preparing students for college. The college readiness trend is driving changes in the ways in which the nation uses student test data. Educational data are no longer limited to static data snapshots showing the status of a student performance at one point in time. Instead data are linked grade-to-grade and course-to-course, to create a longitudinal measure of student performance. Inferences about student progress are now made using status as well as growth models. The new national trend is to enhance the ability to draw inferences about student growth by collecting more direct evidence from longitudinal student data. The use of longitudinal data expands beyond informing about student progress to evaluating teachers and educational leaders. President Obama has repeatedly highlighted the need for teacher effectiveness measures and offered incentives for those who are willing to implement them. The Department of Education awarded billions of dollars from the Race to the Top fund to 11 states and the District of Columbia in 2010. In granting the awards, the Department evaluated state applications for which 28% of the points were dedicated to a section entitled &quot;Great Teachers and Leaders.&quot; As part of the application requirements, states had to develop and describe a system for assessing teacher effectiveness that included student achievement data and provided annual effectiveness ratings for all teachers. States awarded the Race to the Top funds are currently working to implement their plans for teacher effectiveness systems, with most relying on student growth measures as essential measures in their systems. The use of student score changes in different applications has led to confusion in the use of terms and concepts. Terms such as student growth, value-added models, and teacher effectiveness are often used interchangeably. The differences in these three measures are significant. Using one when another is intended has impeded the nation's ability to develop these measures well and to use the information in optimal ways. The goal of this paper is to define student growth, value-added models, and teacher effectiveness, the three terms that are often confused. Furthermore, the paper compares and contrasts features of these three measures and identifies next steps needed for advancing the use of these measures for educational reform.",

This study employed a phenomenological approach and used semi-structured individual interviews and document analysis with 12 self-identified multiracial students from two small, private, liberal arts, predominately White institutions in the Midwest. The primary research question was: In what ways does the college environment affect the racial identity development of multiracial students at two small, private, liberal arts, predominantly White institutions in the Midwest? Overall, four key findings emerged. Within one of the findings, participants indicated that the college environment affected their racial identity development in the following ways: (a) contributed to their growth and awareness, (b) constructed support and challenge, and (c) produced feelings of multiracial identity disenfranchisement. This study found that the academic, social, and personal contexts of higher education influence multiracial students' racial identity development. To that end, institutions of higher education must actively create supportive contexts that create a campus climate of inclusion for multiracial students.

				"dc:description" : "Alternative education has become an integral program, in one form or another throughout most school districts in the United States. Alternative education is a very complex and controversial issue that is best understood through the stories of former alternative education students looking back on their lived experiences. Children in the alternative education program studied here were generally those who did not fit into a general education program due to behavior problems or lack of academic success. The purpose of the study was to investigate alternative education primarily through in-depth interviews and case studies of 18 previous alternative education students who were voluntary participants and secondarily through interviews of current alternative education professional staff. The main research question was: In what ways has the study program been meeting the needs of students in the alternative education program, and in what ways may it be improved? The sub questions were the following: (a) Which aspects of this alternative education program are effective or ineffective and why, according to former participants? and (b) Which strategies utilized in the alternative education program may be useful in general education classrooms, according to the participants? Results revealed that the majority of students viewed the alternative education experience as positive if there was a patient, supportive, caring adult in their school life. The study program was effective in meeting the needs of the students through low student-to-teacher ratios, highly structured classrooms, school and community mentors, and high quality academic instruction. However, more of the following is needed: funding for some students who need services outside the school, initial and continuing education for staff to counter teacher burn-out and stereotyping of students, space to alleviate overcrowding, parent involvement, and leadership. Ten themes emerged from the data: anger, victim mentality, neglect, abandonment, apathy, self-doubt, bullying, academic struggles, unequal prospects, and most important--a relationship with a caring adult.

				"dc:description" : "Research suggests that the pedagogical thoughts of postsecondary teachers exist on a continuum from student-centered to teaching-centered orientations, the latter of which are more pedagogically effective than the former. However, this body of literature has been critiqued for insufficient conceptualization of psychological constructs and the lack of connection to research in cognitive psychology. In this thesis I advance a multi-dimensional account of faculty practice based on situative theories of cognition that address these gaps. Using thematic, data reduction (i.e., cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling), social network, and thematic network analysis techniques, I examine interviews and classroom observations from 56 science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) faculty from three public research universities in the U.S. Results indicated that 15 types of beliefs could be discerned from the data, with the most widely held being that students best learn through practice and persistence. These beliefs can be grouped into two clusters that appear to have an underlying dimensionality characterized by which agent (teacher or student) is seen as primarily responsible for constructing meaning. Additionally, two beliefs (i.e., practice and perseverance, and that people learn according to different styles) appear to be stand-alone beliefs unrelated to this dimension. Further, 37 faculty in the study reported beliefs that cut across the two clusters and stand-alone beliefs, thereby indicating that most faculty cannot be characterized as holding a particular &quot;type&quot; of belief. Analyses of classroom observation data using social network analysis resulted in five distinct configurations of teaching dimensions across the disciplinary groups in the study. Case studies of three faculty demonstrate how beliefs, goals, prior knowledge, and perceived affordances within the organizational context all interact to shape planning and teaching. Results suggest that: (a) a multi-dimensional account of planning and teaching that focuses on tracing a single element throughout the instructional process provides a detailed account of faculty practice, (b) efforts to label individuals as holding a particular &quot;type&quot; of belief, and corresponding assumptions regarding the efficacy of their teaching, should be avoided, and, (c) beliefs alone do not determine practice but they interact with other features to help define problem spaces for teaching.

				"dc:description" : "The changing educational needs of undergraduate students have not been addressed with a corresponding development of instructional methods in higher education classrooms. This study used a phenomenological approach to investigate a classroom-based instructional model called the &quot;inverted&quot; or &quot;flipped&quot; classroom. The flipped classroom incorporates technologies to move lecture content online, allowing for a more learner-centered classroom environment. The purpose of the study is to explore the experience of instructors who have adopted this model for their classroom-based undergraduate courses. The participant set includes a range of teaching experience, discipline, and institutional setting. Participants share a transition from a more traditional, teacher-centered practice as well as early adopter traits. Individual, semi-structured, VoIP interviews were held and course materials analyzed. The data collection and analysis process produced a rich set of data that provides a multilayered view of participant experiences adopting the model. Findings for instructors include the following points: The model, at its best, has a complex structure requiring careful instructional design and implementation. The focus of course design centers on a series of inversions and connections that make the model successful. The primary goal is an active learning environment in the classroom. The model builds on the relationships it affords to instructors and students, leading to more differentiated instruction and increased student involvement. Findings for faculty development personnel and administrators include the following points: The participants are relearning to teach over time through a process of discovery. Their concern for the learning experiences of their students directs their choices and efforts. They appreciate the autonomy inherent in their role, as it enables them to act in response to student need. The experiences of the participants indicate that there is still work to be done in the area of supporting instructors in the classroom. Instructors are reaching for more learner-centered approaches. The emphasis on technology use and online teaching may steer many instructors away from receiving guidance and assistance in improving their classroom-based teaching practices. By facilitating a learner-centered approach, this model can contribute to undergraduate education in the face-to-face environments that constitute the primary setting for college courses.

This phenomenon has been addressed extensively in educational research. However, not much empirical research has been conducted to investigate whether a complementary assessment, such as the clinical interview, would provide more information about African American students' mathematical knowledge than a standardized test. Qualitative clinical interview methodology was used to explore the performance of the student participants on the clinical interviews and on the standardized test as well as teacher feedback about these students' mathematical knowledge. Data were gathered from three main sources: clinical interviews, standardized test results, and teacher interviews. Data were coded to identify common themes that shed light on the research questions. Most of the students performed better on specific items from the standardized assessment, the New Jersey Proficiency Assessment of State Standards (NJPASS), than on the clinical interview items. The scores on both assessments revealed much disparity among participants' mathematical competencies. The clinical interviews affirmed or changed the teachers' opinions of their students. The information from the clinical interviews fostered discussion of pedagogical practices. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

				"dc:description" : "With the recent addition of engineering to most K-12 testable state standards, efficient and comprehensive instruments are needed to assess changes in student knowledge and perceptions of engineering. In this study, I developed the Students&apos; Awareness and Perceptions of Learning Engineering (STAPLE) instrument to quantitatively measure fourth through eighth grade students&apos; knowledge of, interest in, and efficacy toward engineering. STAPLE was developed using four samples for four separate analyses: content expert review (n = 15), field-test (n = 40), pilot-test (n = 576), and confirmatory test (n = 1,007). Content experts had expertise in either engineering education or gifted education. Students in grades four through eight completed the field-test, pilot-test, and confirmatory test. Item Response Theory (IRT) analysis was used to analyze the dichotomous knowledge items, while factor analysis was used to analyze the six-point scaled interest and efficacy items. IRT analysis of the knowledge items revealed that seven items should be removed from STAPLE in order for the instrument to yield reliable results. Factor analysis on the interest and efficacy items revealed three factors: Interest in Engineering, Efficacy toward Engineering Global and Social Dynamics, and Efficacy toward Engineering Process and Design. Fit statistics were adequate for each of the factors. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that male students had higher mean factor scores for Interest in Engineering and Efficacy toward Engineering, while female students had higher factor scores for Efficacy toward Engineering Global and Social Dynamics. Additionally, students identified as gifted had higher factor scores for Engineering Global and Social Dynamics; however, students not identified as gifted had higher factor scores for Interest in Engineering and Efficacy toward Engineering Process and Design. These results have implications for engineering instruction and interventions. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

				"dc:description" : "This dissertation thesis describes a research inquiry that took place at a large Midwestern University, in the Fall semester of 2009, is comprised of three case studies, and attempts to respond to the question: &quot;How do prospective teachers perceive, think about, and respond to the instructionally relevant variation of their students&quot;. Instructionally Relevant Variation (IRV) is conceptually related to notions of pedagogy, characteristics of students and the mediating spaces between students and teachers, and indicates a set of qualities, or markers, that is fluid and all encompassing. IRV is used to represent competencies and circumstances that impact teaching and learning, while allowing for overlap and gradation. IRV stands for, not only those qualities that are innate or long-term, but also circumstances that may be punctual, or of short-duration (including the child's relationship with their teacher), and that either provide affordances or prevent learning from occurring if a teacher-lead action does not take place. This study is based on the premise that Three Problems of Practice promote particular ways of &quot;seeing&quot; and &quot;doing&quot; which compel teachers to see narrow categories of children. Thus, Preservice teachers that are prepared in programs that are steeped within narrow notions of Multicultural Education, conceptualizations of professionalization based on expertise areas, and induction practices guided by silent binaries, might have restricted perceptions of children, and have difficulty identifying IRVs that fall outside of the purview of their pre-conceived professional lens and, in turn, have restricted ways of seeing and doing which result into unresolved tensions when attempting to plan and instruct ALL students. This investigation is based upon three case-studies, and follows three pre-service teachers in their first semester of the internship year. The participants were followed throughout 14 weeks, both in a graduate course on Literacy and in their internship placements, and while they planned and instructed students within the context of a literacy unit. All the work produced by the participants during the semester was gathered and analyzed, and further augmented with informal conversations, semi-structured interviews, and on-site observations. Because this is an investigation that delves into discursive practice and discourse-in-practice, an interpretative analysis method (Holstein, J.A., &amp; Gubrium, F.F., 2011) was used to analyze the context and transcripts of all oral interactions. The results of this investigation indicate that while all three participants perceived, thought about and responded to their students IRVs, their responses (breadth and depth) were influenced by different conceptualizations of teaching/learning. The argument will be made that a combined approach to RTI, DI and CRP will allow for the transformation of Problems into Possibilities of Practice and a change in the ways in which Pre-service teachers &quot;stand,&quot; &quot;see,&quot; and &quot;do,&quot; thus allowing for a wider perspective into students' IRVs. By combining these three pedagogical approaches and creating environments that are based upon the central premises of an Inquiry as Stance lens, combined with a commitment to teach all students, and a disability studies framing of normalcy, pre-service teachers will enter the classrooms with a wider set of &quot;tools&quot; with which to entangle and breakthrough the tensions associated with teaching ALL students.

				"dc:description" : "Knowledge of local norms and conventions of interaction and ability to use them appropriately as well as the ability to negotiate meaning with interlocutors are important for ESL graduate students and prospective teaching assistants in an English-speaking university context. The interactive communication (IC) assessment using a paired student conversation task was developed for Purdue's Oral English Proficiency Program to supplement a curriculum that focused mainly on academic language and classroom teaching presentations. The main goal of this formative classroom assessment is to help students improve face-to-face interaction skills in English, including negotiation of meaning, active listening, and conversation management; and to give OEPP instructors a broader view of students' ability to communicate in English in interactive contexts. Recordings of paired student IC assessment conversations were studied and transcribed to determine if assessment goals and criteria corresponded to actual student performances, and to provide evidence for further development and validation of the IC assessment. Results and evidence from this study were used to revise assessment goals and criteria, to provide examples and benchmarks for instruction and rating, and to revise the assessment rating scale and scoring guidelines. All existing criteria were found to be relevant but reference to body language was found to be lacking. The assessment rating scale was changed from a five-point to a three-point scale. Rater orientation was carried out to familiarize raters with the new scale. Raters' scores and written comments were studied to see if raters could agree to a reasonable extent on how to interpret and apply the scale, and if individual raters could use the entire scale and follow scoring guidelines consistently. Reasonable agreement was found, but raters did not often use the lowest point on the scale. The final study looked at results of a student course survey which used a Likert scale and contained items on student attitudes about the IC and use of IC skills outside of the classroom. Survey responses indicated that most students valued and liked the IC assessment, and especially liked having conversations with classmates. Most students indicated that they used the IC skills outside of the classroom, and that IC conversation practice had made them better listeners, had allowed them to develop better relationships with classmates, and had made them more comfortable conversing in English with acquaintances outside of the classroom. Implications are that interaction skills developed during practice conversations in the classroom are portable to other contexts of interaction; and that greater comfort conversing in English may lead to development of relationships with local English speakers, which can be an effective pathway for improving interactive competence and overall oral English proficiency.

				"dc:description" : "This study explored the experiences of mathematics teachers as they examined recommendations for &quot;Reasoning and Sense Making&quot; (NCTM, 2009) and investigated them in their practice through action research. Narrative inquiry was used to capture the ways that teachers conceptualized the curricular recommendations, the actions teachers took to incorporate the recommendations into their practice, the challenges and opportunities teachers encountered, and teachers&apos; interpretations. Given the trend in mathematics education to focus on the deficit between NCTM curricular recommendations and mathematics classroom practices across the United States (e.g., Hiebert, 1999; Stigler &amp; Hiebert, 1999), this research expands the discourse by illuminating the complex nature of teachers&apos; experiences as they attempted to enact changes to align their teaching with curricular recommendations. The findings of this study, presented through narratives that capture the experiences, illustrate the complex process of teacher change in ways unique from past research. The narratives reveal the sensible nature of teachers&apos; actions and interpretations by illuminating their meaning in the context of teachers&apos; work. The challenges that teachers&apos; encountered are captured as lived moments of struggle for the reader to experience vicariously. While others have written about individual challenges encountered when attempting to change their own practice (e.g., Ball, 2000; Cady, 2006; Chazan, 2000; Frykholm, 2004; Heaton, 2000; Verkaik &amp; Ritsema, 2006), this study brings together the experiences of seven teachers to illustrate both the uniqueness of each teacher&apos;s experiences as well as the common elements amidst their complex journeys. By using the recommendations for &quot;Reasoning and Sense Making&quot; as a theme for teachers&apos; work, the findings are positioned to be informative about teachers&apos; ways of conceptualizing and making changes in their teaching in the context of current recommendations.

				"dc:description" : "Although there has been a surge in the number of adults entering accelerated academic programs at community colleges over the last decade, there has not been a similar increase in the number of adult learners who persist and achieve their degrees. This qualitative inquiry uses a case study methodology to explore in what ways educational philosophies of educators influence the persistence and graduation rates of adult students in community college accelerated programs. Data collection methods will include the creation of focus groups of both faculty and adult students in the accelerated program and faculty members taking the online version of the Zinn (1991) Philosophy of Adult Education Inventory (PAEI). Analysis of the findings will utilize the results of the Zinn's PAEI, Knowles' (1980) six assumptions of adult education as well as the emerging themes arising from the data. This study will provide information that will improve the understanding of the role of faculty educational philosophy on the successful achievement by adult learners as measured by persistence and graduation. These insights will also provide the information needed by community colleges to create a positive adult learning environment as they formulate and implement adult accelerated courses and programs and recruit faculty to teach in them. There was no consensus among the student graduates regarding if the manner in which faculty taught had any influence on their decision to persist in the adult accelerated program. The results indicated that students reacted more positively and related better to faculty who brought real life, practical knowledge into the classroom than faculty who lectured from a theoretical perspective. Additional findings made it quite apparent that the student graduate participants possessed an intense internal desire and self-determination to be persistent and complete the necessary courses to finish a degree. Lastly, students strongly voiced the need for faculty and the college administration to create an environment which promotes a desire to learn, which in turn motivates them to persist and complete their degree.

				"dc:description" : "Three worries seem to plague Grice&apos;s theory of meaning. If, as Grice seems to hold, utterer intentions, including the meaning intention (M-intention), are to be epistemically prior to what some utterance--what some sentence or phrase-means, then one should be able to translate utterances from a language radically different from one&apos;s own, merely by accessing the M-intention. Yet such cannot be done without first understanding the utterance. Such is the Davidsonian Doubt. When an utterer S utters something x with an M-intention, S means something, which might not be the same thing as the utterance x&apos;s meaning. Call what S means the &quot;S-meaning&quot; and what the utterance-type means &quot;U-meaning.&quot; Given the psychological priority of speaker centrism, U-meaning should at least be analyzed in terms of S-meaning, and ultimately in terms of the M-intention. Yet Grice sometimes analyzes U-meaning without any reference or seeming need for M-intentions, and sometimes analyzes S-meaning in terms of U-meaning, violating so-called &quot;speaker centrism.&quot; Hence, the Priority Ambiguity. If Grice intends his analysis of the M-intention to be an account of its constitutive elements, then the indefinitely many intentions that constitute an adequate M-intention give reason to doubt both the capacity of any finite utterer to have an M-intention and the ability of any finite audience to calculate it and thereby comprehend meaning. But clearly we do understand meanings, so this complexity is problematic. This final worry is thus over M-intention Complexity. If Grice intended his to be an account of the elements of an M-intention and that this intention be epistemically more accessible than meanings, then his account is deeply flawed, and we have good reason to reconsider its merit. The Doubt and the Ambiguity are motivated by and entail a reductionist program. Such a program analyzes concepts in terms of other concepts taken to be more epistemically or ontologically basic. Given reductionism, circularity is a serious flaw. The traditional interpretation holds that Grice epistemically reduces the semantic (U-meaning) to the psychological (intentions); i.e., they understand him to hold that the psychological is epistemically more accessible than the semantic. But Grice rejected reductionism, thus the traditional interpretation of Grice as a reductionist and the problems that follow from it are beside the point. Grice had a unique &quot;constructivist&quot; approach to analysis whereby related entities a and ß are on a par, allowing for a to be analyzed in terms of ß in one conceptual scheme and ß in terms of a in another without any vicious circularity. Grice&apos;s constructivism also allows for multiple conceptual schemes within a single ontological scheme (e.g., the semantic). And it entails that there are no basic entities. By showing that the Doubt and the Ambiguity both rely on reductionism, and by demonstrating Grice&apos;s constructivism to be anti-reductionist, I demonstrate that the first two important worries are irrelevant. Grice&apos;s constructivism entails that whenever there is a &quot;rational demand&quot;--a logical or conceptual need for explanatory entities--there is justification for the &quot;construction&quot; of such entities, and of theories that account for their interrelation, by means of a set of &quot;construction routines.&quot; Since Grice&apos;s theory of meaning intersects psychological and semantic concepts, there is a rational demand for an account of not only their interrelation, but also of each concept. Grice supplies such in his widely neglected works on reason and value. Reinterpreting Grice&apos;s theory of meaning according to his constructivist program in light of his theories of reason and value both justifies the discarding of the Doubt and the Ambiguity and lays the groundwork for a rethinking of M-intention Complexity. That the explanation of x is complex need not entail that x is likewise complex. The regress that makes up the M-intention Complexity is a feature of explanation, not constitution: it is an explanatory, not ontological or epistemological regress. As such, it is not only benign, but is in fact characteristic of a &quot;reciprocal&quot; analysis. Concepts in a constructivist program are analyzed in terms of each other with no contradiction, depending upon which conceptual scheme the analysis presupposes. To worry about it in Grice&apos;s account of meaning is to misunderstand him. And to worry about explanatory complexity is to fail to grasp his constructivism. Thus, the reductionist traditional interpretation of Paul Grice&apos;s theory of meaning needs to be discarded and replaced with an integrative interpretation like mine--an interpretation based on his constructivism.

It was perpetrated by ethnic Russians living in Estonia who were incensed by the movement of a bronze war memorial for Russian soldiers to a grave yard from the center of town (Evron, 2008, p. 122). The cyber riot was nearly simultaneous with the actual real world riots. This brought the idea of cyber warfare and conflict in cyberspace into the public view. It may be better to replace the idea of asymmetric threats with the idea of strategic threats as the threat may not be asymmetric (e.g. large scale cyber warfare) but the adversary's strategy is asymmetric in effort. If according to Clausewitz, we are willing to accept that there are two primary things needed for war (politically opposed will-power and the ability to field a military) then a missing element of cyber warfare may be the ability to field a military (Szafranski, 1990, p. 39). This research states, &quot;Given the unstructured domain of cyber warfare knowledge a specific model will allow experts to produce a concept map significantly more detailed than absent the model.&quot; Experts were solicited in a variety of venues to map cyber warfare using a concept mapping process and provide a deeper understanding of the concept. Two technology-centric models were given to groups of experts to assist them in explaining elements of cyber conflict. One group was just given the cyber warfare question and no specific model as guidance. The groups were then compared to see if either of the models had better explanatory power per the experts responses.

				"dc:description" : "Using the embedded case study method, this investigation described the experiences, relationships, and perspectives of administrative leaders within the higher education environment during the most recent economic crisis, specifically attempting to answer the question of, &quot;How does an economic crisis, like the most current recession, impact a university leader's ability to deal with the issues of faculty recruitment, retention and support?&quot; Participants in the study were 8 administrators from Purdue University, a Land-grant institution. In addition to the interview data related documentation was also examined, and analysis of all the data collected resulted in the development of 75 descriptive codes which were then categorized into a total of eight emergent themes within the study. The eight emergent themes included: (1) leadership insights; (2) sense of mission or business as usual; (3) negative consequences of the recession; (4) Perceptions/Attitudes/Feelings/Assumptions/Values/assumptions/values; (5) alternative strategies; (6) positive consequences of the recession; (7) the quest for information and input; and (8) other significant concerns. Outcomes of the study were that the recession had an impact on each area of question within the study: recruitment, retention, support and the relationship, and dealt with the impact with the use coping mechanisms. For recruitment, the recession had an impact in the area of hiring faculty as the number during this timeframe was decreased but not halted altogether. In regard to retention efforts, the recession made it harder to retain top-performing faculty but the university launched an initiative to assist their colleges and schools to try and support those efforts. As administrators were unable to provide support to their faculty with raises and other means during this time, they emphasized the idea of making the faculty feel valued by decreasing their workloads whenever possible. Finally, to ensure the relationship between the faculty and administration was not altered, the leadership employed communication and transparency with the situation whenever possible. Based upon this research, recommendations for future university leadership facing an economic crisis include: (1) more inclusion of faculty and staff early in the decision making process; (2) accessibility of administration to stakeholders; and (3) developing mechanisms for enhancing communication. Implications for future research include a number of studies such as a complimentary study done with the faculty, staff and other stakeholders at Purdue University to gain insight into the other side of these issues; a study with peer institution for a comparative study; and a study with private or community college for yet another comparative, but different study environment.

				"dc:description" : "Online learning continues to be a growing frontier in higher education with increased demand and enrollments reported annually (Allen &amp; Seaman, 2010, 2011). Discovering best practices and methods of instruction as well as assisting students in determining their highest possible level of success in this type of learning environment has been the focus of much recent research. This study investigates the relationship between success in an online academic environment and student personality type as assessed by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator®. Specifically, the present research focused on the following research questions: (1) is one personality type more likely to enroll in an online course? (2) Is there a positive relationship between academic success (i.e., a passing grade) and a specific personality type? (3) Is there a positive relationship between academic failure (i.e., a failing grade) and a specific personality type? These questions are important to examine given the popularity of online learning because their answers help enable optimal fit between student and learning environment. The sample frame consisted of 1201 students from a variety of academic majors seeking to fulfill a degree requirement through a course offered in an online learning environment. The sample contained 102 students seeking degrees in eleven colleges in a large Midwestern university. Fifteen of the sixteen possible personality-type categories differentiated by the MBTI® were represented, and thirty-six online learning environments were exemplified. The results indicate the likelihood of enrollment did not differ by personality type; further, there was no positive relationship between academic success and one personality type. A relationship between academic failure and a given personality type could not be assessed due to the grade range restriction reported. No failing grades were indicated by participants. A post-hoc analysis using recursive partitioning did indicate several interesting breaks in the data by college and gender, which may prove useful for further analysis. Additional recommendations for future research are discussed. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

				"dc:description" : "This study examined classroom interactions to determine the challenges that community college students encounter in the online learning environment. These challenges can affect college students&apos; attrition rates and are important to college administrators seeking to increase online retention. The purpose of this study was to investigate the challenges and issues that deter the success of online community college learners and to develop an orientation program that addressed these issues in order to increase persistence. The theoretical framework for this study was Tinto&apos;s theory on separation, transition, and incorporation. This model closely aligns with the research questions related to the challenges of the online college learner. Using a mixed methods approach, a random sample of 5 online classes was selected from a population of 19 classes. Data collection and analysis were done using a sequential explanatory design by which the quantitative data were collected and analyzed before collection and analysis of the qualitative data. The quantitative data were collected using a Likert survey that measured the students&apos; perceptions and interactions in the online classroom. Using the same sample classes, the qualitative data were collected from the college course instructors using informal, unstructured interviews. The findings revealed that online students experience barriers to their educational success; the solution was an orientation program designed to address these online challenges and to increase retention. This orientation program promotes positive social change by its potential to improve student performance, increase academic success, and promote a more educated society.

This study provides a preliminary understanding of (i) the conceptualization of education quality that was explicit or implicit in project designs over time; (ii) the interventions carried out to enhance education quality; and (iii) the impact of interventions. The results of this study are being used to inform the larger three-year EQUIP1study, the Cross-national Synthesis of Education Quality. The four consecutive education projects in Malawi funded by USAID between 1991 and the present were studied. The study was guided by the following general questions which probe the relationship between project interventions and resultant education quality at the primary level: (1) How has education quality been conceptualized and measured within a series of projects or an integrated program?; (2) What educational interventions are identified as having had a positive effect on quality?; (3) What interventions have not had an impact on quality?; (4) Have the interventions had different impacts in different educational environments?; (5) What are the long-term effects of interventions on the system, teachers, schools, communities, and student outcomes? Are the programs or ideas from the programs being sustained or incorporated into government policies and programs?; and (6) Do the documents available reveal local voices or points of view concerning the impact of programs?

				"dc:description" : "This dissertation reports the results of a content analysis of Introductory Sociology textbooks in order to assess their coverage of, and approach to, the teaching of &quot;culture&quot; in the hopes of ultimately creating a unified approach for the introduction of students to the sociology of culture. Looking at introductory sociology textbooks, the current study documents if and to what extent the topic of culture is included; and if so, analyzes which topics are included, how much space is dedicated to culture, and particularly which frames (in Goffman&apos;s (1974 [1986]) sense) are used to present sociology of culture. The results of this research highlight three important tendencies of introductory texts. Firstly, there is an apparent inconsistency between current academic work in the sociology of culture and inclusion of that work in introductory textbooks. This is particularly true of cultural production. Additionally, textbooks are extremely likely to treat culture as a concept in an anthropological sense (including a discussion of language, norms, and values) or in terms of diversity or multiculturalism. Finally, textbooks on the whole do not appear to change over time in significant ways. This is certainly not the case from edition to edition (usually a span of one to two years), but also among textbooks from different time periods (the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s).

				"dc:description" : "Professional school counselors (PSCs) can play a vital role to help keep truant students in school by providing school-based interventions that target the personal barriers of attachment, engagement, and empowerment that may limit success in school. ASCA national standards encourage PSCs to demonstrate accountability for student outcomes. The American School Counselor Association (ASCA) emphasizes the role of the school counselor in assisting students with academic performance and social and emotional well-being. Based on attachment, engagement, and empowerment theories, this study seeks to understand the relationship between PSC led treatment and student (a) social bonds and support systems (engagement), (b) social skills development (attachment), (c) academic monitoring skills (engagement), and (d) personal self-awareness and self-regulation skills (empowerment) with at-risk high school students as defined by truancy. To this end, attachment, engagement, and empowerment have been measured before and after the implementation of PSC led school-based interventions.

				"dc:description" : "With the passing of legislation like the No Child Left Behind Act (2002) and an increased focus on continuous improvement in public education, professional development has progressed from a passive form of learning for educators to a process in which educators are interacting, collaborating, and learning through various methods. This study utilized a mixed methods approach employing primarily a qualitative focus using phenomenological research procedures. The purpose of this study was to uncover what practices administrators believe to be effective when instituting professional development on their campus. Additionally, the researcher also measured the level at which the participating administrators believed their current practices were when aligned to the National Staff Development Council&apos;s standards for professional learning. Interview data revealed four themes that administrators believed to comprise effective professional development practice. The themes were interactive learning experiences, needs-based content, practical application of content, and follow-up and on-going practices. The quantitative data suggest that the participating administrators believe their professional development practices support the notion that professional development is seen as a key component to continuous improvement on their campus and is an integral part of their campus culture. The participants&apos; beliefs about their practices were high when related to the professional development standard of leadership and were lowest when related to the &quot;evaluation&quot; standard.

				"dc:description" : "Increasingly, females are taking the helm as president of colleges and universities in the United States, yet men still hold the majority of presidential positions (ACE, 2012). The Ivy League is an exception. In the Ivy League, the presidency is held by an equal number of females and males. For three of four Ivy League institutions where females are leading, it is the first time the institution has been led by a woman. This study explored the factors that influenced the career advancement and leadership styles of the four female Ivy League presidents, with insights from three of the four females&apos; former president and mentor/advisor, Dr. Harold Shapiro, President Emeritus of Princeton University. The theoretical framework for the study includes Bass&apos; (1999) theory of transformational leadership where leaders challenge assumptions, seek change, encourage creativity, and display behaviors of collaboration; Donovan&apos;s (2006) liberal feminist theory that suggests education engenders democracy; Chafetz&apos; (1997) cultural feminist theory, a form of radical feminism that embraces the distinct differences between males and females; and Epstein&apos;s (1999) generativity theory, where he posits that newness is a hallmark of creativity; among others. This study used a descriptive mixed method, case study approach. The factors that have influenced the four female Ivy League presidents&apos; careers and their insights into their leadership styles were compared from online video interviews, printed interviews, and a face-to-face interview with Dr. Shapiro. The results suggest that the four female presidents exhibit strong behaviors in transformational leadership styles; that their careers were influenced by their ability to be creative, both personally and professionally; and influences from family members, former teachers, colleagues, and their own self-efficacy, which advanced their efforts to make a difference and effect change. Females who aspire to become presidents of institutions of higher education can learn from the factors that influenced the careers of the four Ivy League female presidents.

				"dc:description" : "Anson County School District wished to determine the relationship between Fast ForWord Scientific Learning data and North Carolina End of Grade reading scores at Anson Middle School in Anson County, North Carolina. The specific research questions that guided this study include: 1. How does the literacy intervention, Fast ForWord, affect EOG growth scores at the seventh grade level? 2. What factors, including Fast ForWord, best predict a struggling student's scores on the North Carolina End of Grade test? The subjects for data collection were a total of two hundred and ninety-one seventh grade students at a middle school in Anson County, North Carolina. The students were enrolled in seventh grade in the 2010-2011 academic year and in the eighth grade. When correlating the strength of the relationship between the dependent variable, EOG scores, and the independent variable, the number of Fast ForWord products completed, a single linear regression was performed. Based on the regression statistics, R Squared was equal to 0.004. The ANOVA calculations showed a Significance Factor of 0.29. To analyze the impact of multiple variables on an outcome, a multiple regression analysis was used to calculate what factors, including Fast ForWord, best predict a struggling student's scores on the North Carolina End of Grade test. Overall, the study had a statistically significant outcome with models which should be useful to education as these relate to current research in the field of education.

				"dc:description" : "Although there has been much published research on the benefits of distributed practice (Cepeda, Pashler, Vul, Wixted, &amp; Rohrer, 2006) and the testing effect (Eisenkraemer, Jaeger, &amp; Stein, 2013), very few studies are available regarding cumulative testing in college courses. Those available show a benefit to cumulative testing (Lawrence, 2014; Rohm, Sparzo, &amp; Bennett, 1986; Szpunar, McDermott, &amp; Roediger, 2007). As baseline information for a future study of cumulative testing, the current study investigated how well 150 college students recalled previous material when given unannounced cumulative items on a final exam. (Cumulative items were not counted toward students&apos; grades.) Four sections of an undergraduate human development class formed the sample. Two professors taught two sections each and administered separately-developed exams throughout the semester. For the final exam, each professor chose ten multiple-choice items from each of the first and second tests of the semester to include on the final exam. The number of students missing the items on the final was compared to the number missing the same items earlier in the semester. A paired t-test showed a statistically significant increase in the overall number of students missing the items on the final exam. The size of the difference did not depend on whether the items were from Test 1 or Test 2, although it did differ by professor, with an effect size of 0.38 for Professor A and 1.15 for Professor B. A Pearson&apos;s correlation between the overall number of students missing each item before and on the final was 0.51, indicating that items previously missed by larger numbers of students were not necessarily the ones missed by the most students on the final exam. This correlation differed by professor, as well (0.65 for Professor A; 0.45 for Professor B).",

				"dc:description" : "It has been reported (Aagaard &amp; Skidmore, 2004; Sikorski et al., 2002) that only a minority of college students actually read the course textbook in preparation for examinations. Although professors widely lament students' propensity to ignore the carefully chosen textbooks, research specifically investigating why this phenomenon occurs is minimal. Bookstores have reported that fewer students are buying textbooks, perhaps due to rising costs (Mehegan, 2004). A volunteer sample of 19 undergraduate students at a regional university in the midsouth participated in a semi-structured focus group interview regarding their use of college textbooks. Questions were asked concerning textbook cost, course requirements related to the text, student knowledge of textbook features, performance in the course related to textbook use, and the pros and cons of e-textbooks. Researchers took notes on a laptop and also audio-taped the interview. Student responses were analyzed using the constant-comparative method. Results indicated that students were buying textbooks, although they felt that any further rise in cost might prohibit them from purchasing texts for all courses. Generally, students reported that they were not reading the textbooks, as such. They used them more as a reference in case they needed further explanation of a concept they didn't fully understand from the professor's lecture, notes of the lecture, or the additional material (PowerPoint slides, diagrams, etc.) made available online by the professor. Students liked having physical texts, but some were open to the idea of e-textbooks. They noted that being asked questions over information that was covered only in the textbook would get them to at least skim the assigned chapters. Frustration was expressed with teachers who assigned a text but never required anything that would force use of the textbook by students. Interview questions for textbook focus groups are appended.",

				"dc:description" : "Schools have identified that the use of Teacher Assistants often provides needed additional support in the school setting. In a Health Care Facility that provides inpatient psychiatric services, children ages 5-14 are required to engage in school activities. Currently there are no Teacher Assistants trained in the facility. This study focuses on the development of a training module that will train Health Service Technicians to become Teacher Assistants, providing an added level of support in the inpatient school setting. By using the added resources such as the Health Service Technicians, the training process can be developed in a shorter time. The HSTs already provide a direct role relationship with the children during times that they are not in the classroom. By changing attitudes within the ranks, the classroom setting would become a better environment. The training process was conducted in four phases: DVD training Modules, informal interviews pre-training, informal interviews post-training, and observations.

Suggested strategies to remedy this situation include quizzes (Ruscio, 2001; Ryan, 2006), study worksheets (Aagaard &amp; Skidmore, 2009; Ryan, 2006), shorter reading assignments and use of the textbook during class time (Aagaard &amp; Skidmore, 2009). A convenient cluster sample of 105 undergraduate students at a regional university in the midsouth completed a survey regarding their use of college textbooks, what strategies might increase the likelihood of their reading textbook assignments, and their preference for how class time was used. Participants were 60% female and fairly evenly distributed across the four years of college experience. Chi-square was run on 25 selected comparisons, with a Bonferroni correction of the resulting alphas. A majority of students (52%) reported that they do read the assigned textbook readings. Freshmen were significantly more likely to report that outside reading should not be required, and less likely to report having used or known about e-textbooks. Strategies reported to most likely prompt reading the textbook included in-class quizzes over text material (73% overall, but females were significantly more likely to read because of quizzes), assigning graded study-guides to complete while reading (77%); testing over material found in the textbook but not covered in class (81%); and assigning shorter reading assignments (77%). Sixty-four percent of respondents overall preferred group presentations, but sophomores and seniors opted for individual work, while juniors preferred groups. Additionally, students reported preferring the use of PowerPoint lectures to notes on the chalkboard, and generally preferred the use of group discussion and application of material to real-life rather than just lecture over textbook content.

				"dc:description" : "This evaluation was undertaken as a method of gathering, providing, and analyzing data that would assist educators at a weekend school in ascertaining the perceptions of stakeholders concerning the school. The evaluation sought to determine various recommendations that, if implemented, would be beneficial to the weekend school under study. Recommendations that could help generate student interest and commitment, provide opportunities for future financing, and improve parental perceptions that could initiate or enhance support for the school were sought by the study. It was determined that the negative perceptions by all the stakeholders were clearly more dominant than the positive perceptions by the same groups. Students seemed to be the only group that provided any reason at all for excitement; the other stakeholders were much too negative to be excited at all.

				"dc:description" : "The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between academic self-efficacy and preferences regarding the use of text materials and in-class activities of college students at a university that serves one of the highest-poverty regions in the United States. A convenient cluster sample of 105 students taking summer classes at a regional university in the mid-south were administered a self-efficacy scale and a survey of textbook use and preferences for in-class activities. Frequency tables of study survey items by self-efficacy group (above vs. below the sample average) were produced and visually inspected for effect size prior to statistical testing. Subsequently, three chi-square tests were conducted with a Bonferroni correction to alpha, lowering it from 0.05 to 0.0167. The data collected supported the idea that students from high-poverty areas enter college with reduced academic self-efficacy, as the average for the entire sample was lower than other published data. Those evidencing below-average academic self-efficacy in this sample were significantly less likely to engage in the strategies that would help them be successful (such as reading their textbooks).",

				"dc:description" : "In North Carolina (NC) there are a total of 58 community colleges, each of which provides a unique approach to handling support for adjunct faculty. The NC Community College System provided a good setting to explore how one state in particular compares to current research on administrative support of adjunct faculty in the areas of hiring, orientation, professional development, and evaluation. This study addressed the following research questions: (1) What adjunct faculty hiring practices have been implemented in North Carolina community colleges? (2) What adjunct faculty orientation practices have been implemented in North Carolina community colleges? (3) What adjunct faculty professional development practices have been implemented in North Carolina community colleges? (4) What adjunct faculty evaluation practices have been implemented in North Carolina community colleges? (5) What is the relationship between adjunct support practices implemented at community colleges and administrators' perceptions of the quality of their adjunct faculty? A total of 208 mid-level administrators from curriculum programs in 42 of the 58 NC community colleges participated in this descriptive quantitative study, via a newly developed, web-delivered survey (46.4% response rate). The study was based on a conceptual model associated with a Human Resource Management (HRM) theory in order to better address administrative support when dealing with adjunct faculty. Little research has been done to examine these support areas individually, allowing this study to clarify and expound upon details regarding recruitment during hiring, orientation practices, professional development programs, and evaluation practices. The outcomes of this study provided insight into the practices of NC community colleges when examining administrative support for adjunct faculty. Practices within the areas of hiring, orientation, professional development and evaluation were examined through frequency analysis. The mid-level administrator most often associated with supporting adjunct faculty was the department chair. Hiring practices were less formal and orientation programs often had a narrow focus. Professional development programs predominately addressed administrative duties and evaluations most often examined course development and delivery. The final question examined the relationship between administrators' perception of adjunct faculty quality and support practices. Orientation program support practices with a focus on the institutional mission had a significant relationship to the administrators' perception of adjunct faculty quality. Overall orientation, professional development and evaluation support practices with a focus on fostering student success had no relationship to administrators' perception of adjunct faculty quality. The findings of this study suggest support for adjunct faculty exists but more should be done to develop a systematic and cyclic approach of support. The next steps in this area of research would be to take these descriptive findings and explore why and how these support practices are in the shape they are in, as well as to better understand how current support practices influence administrator's perceptions of their programs.

				"dc:description" : "Universities worldwide are transitioning to blended learning where technology is used to enhance and augment traditional face-to-face instruction. Investigation of how well blended learning strategies are accepted and adopted in multicultural settings is needed to facilitate this transition. This study investigated factors and barriers that influence faculty attitudes toward the adoption of technology-rich blended learning at Jazan University in Saudi Arabia. The influence of faculty incentives, faculty's technology experience and demographic variables including gender, academic rank were important considerations. In his Diffusion of Innovations model, Everett Rogers identifies five stages in the adoption process: knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation. The amount of time that transpires before adoption is influenced by several factors including readiness of the adoptees, perceived barriers and incentives. Knowledge of technologies may influence readiness for adoption of blended learning. This study employed a mixed method approach using quantitative and qualitative data. Participants were 303 faculty members (234 male, 69 female) from 36 departments. Descriptive statistics, independent t-test, simple and multiple regression analysis, and correlation coefficients were employed. Faculty reported positive attitudes toward blended learning (M = 3.94) on a five point Likert scale. Female faculty (M = 2.88) reported more barriers to implementing blended learning than male faculty (M = 2.49), (t 301 = -4.43, p &lt; 0.05). Female faculty also reported less experience in using educational technologies (M = 3.54), than male faculty (M = 3.95), (t 301 = 3.76, p &lt; 0.05). Faculty experience with educational technologies was a significant predictor of attitudes toward adopting blended learning, F (1,301) = 32.55, p &lt; 0.05. Faculty attitudes toward adoption of blended learning were negatively correlated with perceived barriers (r = -0.30, p &lt; 0.05). There was a positive correlation between attitudes and perceived incentives for adopting blended learning (r = 0.72, p &lt; 0.05). This Saudi university is making progress toward adopting blended learning. Female faculty members appear to be at the beginning of the Rogers implementation stage while male faculty may be approaching confirmation. Male faculty may be further along in adopting blended learning because they perceive fewer barriers and they have more advanced technical skills. Adequate technical support is important for implementing blended learning. Also, professional development programs are needed to support faculty competencies on current and emerging technologies. This support should benefit the faculty's willingness and ability to support blended learning. Future research might consider the impact of various professional development support strategies and infrastructure support on the adoption of blended learning in diverse cultural settings.

				"dc:description" : "A review of current research clearly points to a shortage of highly qualified principal candidates to fill vacancies as &quot;baby boomer&quot; principals reach retirement age. In many school districts across the nation, the principal shortage is already being realized. Principal preparatory programs as well as school districts are working frantically to find and produce highly qualified candidates to fill the void left by retiring school executives. The primary purpose of this research study was to determine the specific skills and competencies needed by aspiring principals in a rural school district in southeastern North Carolina in order to demonstrate growth on the Strategic Leadership, Instructional Leadership, and Cultural Leadership standards on the North Carolina Standards for School Executives Evaluation instrument in preparation for the principalship. The goal of this research was to inform and design a professional development program which successfully transitions assistant principals into the role of principal within this school district.

				"dc:description" : "This study sought to examine and extend the existing knowledge of IBSTPI competencies of instructional design (International Board of Standards for Training, Performance and Instruction, 2000), the instructional rubric standard expectations of Quality Matters (2010), the identified categories of online learning affordances (Kirschner, Strijbos, Kreijns, &amp; Beers, 2004), and job role affordance classifications of e-learning technologies (Bower, 2008). With increased demand for, and offerings of, online education, technological abilities (affordances) available to learners within online learning environments have evolved. However, while IBSTPI instructional design competencies and Quality Matters Rubric standards provide guidelines for the design and evaluation of course design elements, they do not explicitly address technological affordances. The demand and integration of newer technologies into online learning environments requires an evaluation and evolution of the competencies that guide instructional designers, and the standards that measure online course quality. A Spearman&apos;s rho rank correlation research design measured the relationship between instructional competencies, quality standards, and the affordances of online learning. Upon identification of significantly correlated relationships, ordinal logistic regression analysis was employed to determine whether a specific threshold of the independent variable had a particularly strong effect on the dependent variable. Data analysis revealed that significant relationships exist between instructional competencies and technological affordances. In addition, significant relationships exist between quality standard measures and technological affordances of online learning.

				"dc:description" : "Complex navigation (e.g. indoor and outdoor environments) can be studied as a system-of-systems problem. The model is made up of disparate systems that can aid a user in navigating from one location to another, utilizing whatever sensor system or information is available. By using intelligent navigation sensors and techniques (e.g. RFID, Wifi, GPS, embedded sensors on a mobile device, IMU, etc.) and adaptive techniques to switch between them, brings the possibility of an end-to-end navigational multi-agent system-of-systems (MaSoS). Indoor location-based applications have a broad appeal for development in navigation, robotics, gaming, asset tracking, networking, and more. GPS technologies have been successfully leveraged for outdoor navigation, but often lose effectiveness indoors due to a more constrained environment, possible loss of signal, lack of elevation information and need for better accuracy. Increasingly complex problems in navigation allow for the development of a framework for a system-of-systems. Individual systems contain distributed and heterogeneous components that are disparate in nature. Multiple prototypes and a framework for a multi-agent system-of-systems are presented. The purpose of the model is to overcome the limitations of a single technology navigation system. The system creates a classic system-of-systems utilizing existing and developing localization services. The system provides point-to-point path planning and navigation regardless of the transportation medium, location of the user or current environment.

As the instructional leader, they provide direction and exercise influence on teachers and other professional staff members in their buildings at all times. This qualitative study focused on the perceptions of teachers and principals on the instructional behavior exhibited by the principal. Using a phenomenological research design with purposeful sampling, the researcher conducted interviews and focus group interviews with four principals, two assistant principals, two master teachers, and five teachers from four schools in teacher focus groups to identify the perceptions of principals, teachers, and assistant principals and/or master teachers in schools on the instructional behaviors exhibited by their principals in their schools. Common themes and trends were identified by the individual four schools containing different administrative team members and then by the groups participating in this research study which included principals, assistant principals and master teachers, and teacher focus groups. Four common themes emerged from the research: (a) instructional support given to teachers, (b) professional development provided for teachers, (c) feedback given to teachers, and (d) resources provided for teachers categorized the different instructional behaviors exhibited by the principal and identified by the participants. The researcher found that there were more differences than similarities in the perceptions of principals and teachers on the instructional behaviors exhibited by principals in all schools, regardless of the different administrative team members present in the school.

				"dc:description" : "Investigating students' perceptions of their classroom environment is one of the ways researchers and educators can effectively determine what factors may benefit students' learning. Student Perceptions of Classroom Quality (SPOCQ; Gentry &amp; Owen, 2004) was used with a group of Chinese gifted and general secondary students in the study. SPOCQ measures students' perceived appeal, challenge, choice, meaningfulness, and academic self-efficacy in their classes, five factors closely related to students' motivation and learning. The purpose of this study was threefold: to investigate if the Chinese version of the SPOCQ instrument (SPOCQ-C) yields reliable and valid data when used with gifted and general Chinese students at the secondary level; to determine what motivational factors as measured by the SPOCQ-C instrument contribute to predicting the mathematics achievement of secondary students in China; and to investigate differences in the perceptions of gifted and general students, and male and female students. Participants included 486 gifted students and 580 general students from two secondary schools in China. Internal consistency reliability estimates and confirmatory factor analyses revealed that SPOCQ-C consisted of five factors measured by 34 items, the same as its original version. Although the sample could hardly represent the whole population of Chinese secondary students, it was heterogeneous in that it included students from two cities located in mid and south China, and gifted students who were enrolled in regular classes and in self-contained classes. Results of this study provided preliminary evidence in using the instrument with heterogeneous Chinese students at the secondary level. Structural equation modeling approaches were used to examine the causal relationships between the five factors and students' mathematics achievement. Results demonstrated that within students' Zone of Proximal Development, students' perceived levels of challenge directly predicted their mathematics performance. Students' self-efficacy beliefs not only influenced their learning but also predicted their mathematics achievement. Gifted students tended to have higher achievement in mathematics when they saw connections between what they learned and what they experienced in real life. Measurement invariance testing revealed that items on SPOCQ-C functioned equivalently across gifted and general students, and across male and female students. Further mean comparisons provided evidence that gifted students in mixed-ability classes perceived significantly higher levels of challenge and self-efficacy in mathematics classes than their general peers. Besides higher levels of challenge and self-efficacy, gifted students in self-contained classes perceived their mathematics classes to be as appealing as and have more choices than gifted students in regular classes.

				"dc:description" : "As the proportion of children from culturally diverse backgrounds in the nation&apos;s schools increases, the teacher workforce is projected to remain overwhelmingly White, monolingual, and female. These differences are believed to have fostered a cultural mismatch, where teachers are challenged in their ability to meaningfully connect with their culturally diverse students. To narrow the gap in teachers&apos; and students&apos; understanding of each other, diversity instruction has been incorporated into teacher-preparation programs. However, even after participating in the best diversity programs, preservice teachers often feel uncomfortable or underprepared to work with students from culturally diverse backgrounds. This qualitative research case study examined the perspectives of 12 preservice teachers in a reflectively designed, graduate-level, semester-long diversity course to understand the ways in which they perceived themselves as prepared to engage with culturally diverse student populations. Multiple data sources, including in-depth interviews and a review of preservice teacher artifacts, were collected and analyzed. The findings indicated that (a) family socialization had the greatest influence on participants&apos; understanding of diversity, (b) diversity instruction equipped participants with the technical knowledge of teaching and the foundational knowledge of diversity, (c) multiple forums for in-class discussions and reflective writing were the most helpful in participants&apos; learning about diversity, (d) how participants understood themselves was the most significant change to occur as a result of their participation in the diversity course, and (e) an increased self-awareness following the diversity course helped participants apply or advance their diversity knowledge. The implications of this study include the need for diversity instruction that is infused into all aspects of the teacher instructional program and reflective instruction that challenges preservice teachers to examine their beliefs and assumptions about issues of diversity. The findings from this study are applicable to any organization committed to addressing issues of diversity. By providing the tools and forums that can instill reflective practice and develop self-awareness, organizations can assist individuals develop their willingness, ability, and capacity to engage and work effectively across cultural boundaries.

				"dc:description" : "An epidemic such as diabetes is an extremely complex public health, economic and social problem that is difficult to solve through medical expertise alone. Evidence-based models for improving healthcare delivery systems advocate educating patients to become more active participants in their own care. This shift demands preparing chronically ill patients with the competencies of avid lifelong learners who can harness their experiences living with the disease to develop everyday expertise in its self-management. No prior research to date has endeavored to study and support patient everyday expertise development from the learning and human performance systems design field. Moreover, studies of everyday expertise development in the self-management of diabetes by patients in the Dominican Republic are unknown. This exploratory and descriptive study examined patients with varying levels of expertise in order to: 1) Compare them in terms of demographics, health information and behaviors, and depth of knowledge to solve self-management problems, 2) Identify patterns that differentiate them in reference to three major observational learning concepts: live, verbal and symbolic modeling. Participants were 20 diabetic patients participating in a community-based diabetic education program. Data were collected through a semi-structured scenario-based interview that leveraged cognitive probing as a knowledge elicitation method. Analysis of the data involved both quantitative and qualitative approaches and the use of rubrics and multi-case study comparison. Results revealed that everyday expertise development level was associated with patient educational background and years since diagnosis. In terms of health behaviors, the more expert group reported visiting the doctor and measuring their blood glucose levels more frequently. Among diet, exercise and stress, exercise represented the most difficult self-management task for the less expert group to manage on a daily basis but not for the more experts. The more expert group applied significantly higher instances of deeper knowledge across self-management scenarios but was similar to the less expert group in the application of surface knowledge. As for observational learning patterns the former group had access to learn from live models, reacted differently to verbal instructions from doctors, and were more purposeful about consuming health information through media and other sources of symbolic modeling. A major contribution of this research with practical applications in this context consists of a set of ecologically based learning and performance support guidelines for facilitating everyday expertise development. Conclusion, implications for a wide range of stakeholders, limitations and future research are also discussed.

				"dc:description" : "As adult students constitute nearly half of all undergraduates in the United States, college practitioners need to identify effective disciplinary strategies for this population when violations of institutional rules and regulations occur. The purpose of this quasi-experimental, action research study was to modify the student conduct process for adult students referred to State University&apos;s Student Conduct &amp; Community Standards in order to improve the desired learning outcomes: increased awareness of institutional policies, improved ability to understand the impact misconduct has on the campus community, enhanced ability to empathize with the other party involved in the incident, better understanding of the short-term and long-term consequences associated with student misconduct, and reduced likelihood of future recidivism. Multi-dimensional behavioral interventions (i.e., active and passive sanctions) were identified as a potential disciplinary strategy for adult students. To determine how adult students responded to multidimensional behavioral interventions and how effective this sanctioning approach was in increasing learning outcomes within this population, student questionnaires and seven-month recidivism data were utilized. Results, derived from a one-way ANOVA with a 0.05 significance level, confirmed that adult students who received multi-dimensional behavioral interventions exhibited significantly more observable intrinsic gains than students who received only active or passive sanctions: they viewed the conduct process more positively, better understood the views of others, better understood their responsibilities as members of the campus community, expressed more willingness to take responsibility for their actions, and were less likely to exhibit recidivistic behavior.

				"dc:description" : "This study examined the process teachers used to change their pedagogy to deliver effective instruction using Web 2.0 tools. A phenomenological approach examined the &quot;lived experiences&quot; of seven secondary teachers through in-depth interviews giving this study an in-depth qualitative analysis of teachers and technology. The widening digital divide between teachers and students causes a barrier for educators trying to reach their students. Students are raised with pervasive technology, while teachers are using Web 2.0 tools on a personal basis, but may not yet be successful in adapting their pedagogy to effectively use the tools for instruction. The ease of use and user friendly interface of Web 2.0 tools makes them a possible catalyst to help teachers change their pedagogy. Past teacher professional development focused on providing teachers with the technical knowledge to bridge the gap, but has fallen short of causing the paradigm shift needed to change pedagogy to use current tools effectively. The Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework has been used in professional development and proven to lead to an effective change in teachers&apos; pedagogy. Most current research has examined both the TPACK framework and Web 2.0 tools, but few researchers have looked at the teacher perspective on the issue. The findings of this study indicated the types of Web 2.0 tools and how they are being utilized, the reasons why teachers are using the tools for instruction, and the technological factors influencing their use. Lastly, the impact their TPACK had on their success in adapting pedagogy points to the need for support either through professional development or support from colleagues. The &quot;lived experiences&quot; of the teachers provided implications for professional development assisting in making the change process easier for teachers, administrators, and students. This study provided an in-depth look at the relationship between in-service teachers, their TPACK, and how it relates to educational technology. In addition, this study demonstrated the rigorousness of phenomenology as a primary research method for educational technology.

				"dc:description" : "Many educators believe that the act of building relationships is the core of learning. When technology is integrated into every classroom, do relationships improve or disintegrate among the key stakeholders in an educational environment? The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which technology in a 1:1 school district can alter relationships between teacher and teacher as well as between student and teacher. No conclusions are made about all the classrooms involved in a 1:1 initiative, but by describing the effects as perceived by the direct candidates who participated in the interviews, this study aims to inform discussions around one of the aspects of a digital learning environment. This is a qualitative study analyzed through the interviews of teachers who are immersed in a 1:1 initiative in the Mooresville Graded School District in the suburb of Mooresville, North Carolina.

				"dc:description" : "The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) legislation of 2001 increased the stakes for all schools to increase student achievement by mandating all students meet or exceed state standards by 2014. A small rural school responded 5 years ago to their failure to make adequate yearly progress (AYP) by implementing professional learning communities (PLC) as a school wide reform effort to increase achievement. However, AYP status has not changed. An explanatory mixed methods design was used to discover the implementation steps already taken, the strengths and weaknesses of the program, and what prior efforts to address weaknesses had been attempted. Descriptive statistics calculated from a quantitative survey included the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and frequency response rates. Five PLC variables of shared mission and vision, collaboration, supportive conditions, shared and supportive leadership, and results oriented were analyzed. Qualitative data were collected in administrative and faculty interviews to provide greater depth to the quantitative results and determine if different program perceptions existed. The results of the study indicated strengths in collaboration and supportive conditions and weaknesses in the development of a shared mission and vision, use of results, and communication. The leadership variable revealed conflicting perceptions between faculty and administration. Six research based recommendations were provided in order to move forward successfully and ensure sustainability. Implications for positive social change include increasing the number of students who meet or exceed standards on the state exam, graduate from school, and enter into higher education institutions.

				"dc:description" : "Implementation of state and federal high-stakes accountability measures such as end-of-course tests (EoCTs) has contributed to increased teacher stress in the classroom, decreased teacher creativity and autonomy, and reduced effectiveness. Prior research focused primarily on the elementary and middle school levels, so this study sought to examine the perceptions of teachers at the secondary school level. The purpose of this qualitative, single-case study was to examine the perceptions of secondary teachers about the impact of performance-based accountability on their sense of efficacy. Driven by a social constructivist paradigm, the research question focused on the perceptions of 9 secondary teachers about the impact of performance-based accountability. Report card data, average yearly performance data, interview responses, and EoCT data for the 2011-2012 school year were collected. Inductive analysis was used to codify teachers&apos; perceptions, which showed that an increased focus on test data negatively impacted teachers&apos; sense of efficacy. Findings revealed 4 domains regarding teacher experiences: (a) increased stress, (b) increased frustration, (c) growing distrust of the test and the institutions surrounding the test, and (d) loss of respect for their professional judgment in their classrooms. This study calls into question the use of test data to evaluate teacher effectiveness. Findings may contribute to positive social change by informing the current debate on the use of test data in evaluating teachers, and highlighting research indicating that teachers with a greater sense of efficacy may be more effective in the classroom.

				"dc:description" : "This text performs reading for teaching in an audit culture. Two teachers, myself and Steven, read the memoir &quot;Hole in My Life&quot; by Jack Gantos and, while reading, recorded our experiences as readers and planned to teach the book to Steven&apos;s English class. This study is an inquiry into the phenomenon of &quot;reading to teach,&quot; particularly how this mode of reading at once deploys and departs from other modes of reading, such as aesthetic, efferent, and critical postures of engagement. In its anticipation of teaching, this text teaches about how teachers read texts, the aesthetic contours of pedagogy, and how readers and teachers negotiate of inner vision with outer form. I have chosen to write what follows as a kind of memoir that reflects the primary mode of expression offered by the memoir that we read and taught. This research memoir, an elaborated phenomenology, recounts and thinks through what happened as we read, planned, and taught the text. This is also an account of an intellectual, teaching relationship that has taught me much in return about collaboration, what it means to read, and what it means to teach. As Taubman argues (2009), audit cultures in which teachers currently practice minimize opportunities for sustained reflection and thoughtful collaboration. As the time and rhythms of teaching are more externally monitored and controlled through testing and teaching-by-numbers curriculum guides, it becomes difficult to reflect on and practice through ambiguous but vital pedagogical questions. What does it mean to read books in solitude and with others? What responsibilities, possibilities or anxieties does the pedagogical relation offer to (or demand of) reading? How does reflective reading, teaching and research--in the context of friendship--see beyond the limits of audit culture? In what ways are teachers always, already performing these limitations even as they desire to disrupt them? This study raises such questions. I hope that the reader of this text may find it generative of new ways of creating a classroom as a commonplace: a place of common reading occasioned by and leading to deepened understanding of what we can know together.

				"dc:description" : "Music teachers occupy a conflicted and contested position in many secondary schools, and music teacher education programs have been given the task of preparing students to enter this challenging environment. This qualitative dissertation study examined the explicit, implicit, and null curricula of music teacher preparation programs in Massachusetts, the processes involved in determining those curricula and the consequences of selecting certain music education content over others. Degree requirements and course descriptions were analyzed across all undergraduate music teacher preparation programs. In addition, a survey was administered to music and education faculty in all programs and members of five institutions participated in interviews. The explicit curriculum in most music teacher preparation programs emphasized the knowledge and skills of performance, specifically the performance of Western art music, as well as the isolation of music content knowledge from pedagogical knowledge. The implicit message delivered by the explicit curriculum was that advanced musical study was intended for the few, and that popular music, world music, and other genres that deviated from the western art music tradition (i.e. - the null curriculum) were of less value. Using Bernstein's and Young's theories from the sociology of knowledge, Goodson's theory of the status and evolution of school subjects, and Siskin's and Ball and Lacey's work in the culture of secondary school subjects as the theoretical framework, the position of music education was explained as a conflicted content area that demonstrated traits of both high- and low-status subjects. Music education's geographic isolation from general education faculty was magnified by the conflicting views that music educators held when compared with their music performance counterparts. The knowledge boundaries of music content had been defended for centuries, and music education's attempt to redefine what counts as valid music and music education knowledge was met with resistance from those who benefited from the familiarity offered by the conservatory-style model of postsecondary musical study. One outlier was identified, a program whose performance emphasis was not based on western art music. Tradition and reform proved to be challenging dual goals for music educators.

				"dc:description" : "Current CAT applications consist of predominantly dichotomous items, and CATs with polytomously scored items are limited. To ascertain the best approach to polytomous CAT, a significant amount of research has been conducted on item selection, ability estimation, and impact of termination rules based on polytomous IRT models. Few studies investigated the optimal pool characteristics for polytomous CAT implementation. Using the generalized partial credit model (GPCM) (Muraki, 1992), this study aims to identify an optimal item pool design for tests with polytomous items by extending the p-optimality method (Reckase, 2007). The extension includes the definition of atheta-bin to describe polytomous items succinctly for pool design, and item generation strategy using constrained nonlinear optimization method. Optimal item pools are generated using CAT simulations with and without practical constraints. The item pool characteristics under each condition are summarized and their performance is evaluated against an extended operational item pool. The results indicated that the practical constraints of the a-stratified exposure control and content balancing do not affect pool size to a large extent. However, the a-stratified control affects the pool characteristics greatly: the items included in the simulated pools with the control have larger a-parameter and provide higher maximum information on average. On the other hand, the content balancing applied in this study has little impact on pool design. The evaluation results of the pool performance are closely related to the pool characteristics. When the a-stratified exposure control applied, the consistent results include: 1) the average test information is lower than that without the constraint; 2) RMSE is higher and the correlation between the true and estimated abilities is lower; 3) the percentage of the correct classification for the highest achievement level is lower. However, for all the simulated optimal pools, while the test information is consistently above the target level 10.0, it is concluded that the a-stratified method resulted in an efficient use of less discriminative items with small decreases in measurement precision. With regard to the item pool usage, the percentage of items that are fully used, well used, rarely used, and never used are quite comparable for the pools designed with constraints. However, compared with the extended operational pool, when the a-stratified method applied, the conditional test overlap rate of the simulated pools is consistently lower. For the pool blueprint, because the normal ability distribution is assumed, more items are included in the middle of the ability scale for all simulated optimal pools. The distributions of the a- and b- parameters are similar under all conditions. When the a-stratified method applied, there are fewer items in the first stratum and the number of items in the second and third stratum is nearly identical.

				"dc:description" : "Lexical access is the process in which basic components of meaning in language, the lexical entries (words) are activated. This activation is based on the organization and representational structure of the lexical entries. Semantic features of words, which are the prominent semantic characteristics of a word concept, provide important information because they mediate semantic access to words. An experiment was conducted to examine the importance of semantic feature distinctiveness and feature frequency in accessing the lexical representations of young and older adults in an off-line task using features of animals. The McRae, Cree, Seidenberg, and McNorgan (2005) feature norm corpus is the basis for the selection of stimuli for the current research project. Semantic features were utilized to explore the structure of the lexicon. Stimuli varied in feature distinctiveness based on the study by McRae, et al. (2005) in 3 broad stimulus groups: Distinctive (D), Low Frequency Non-Distinctive (LFND), and Non-Distinctive High Frequency (NDHF). Participants were asked to list all of the concepts that came to mind for a given feature in an untimed task. Distinctiveness was examined between stimulus groups for the number of concepts and variety of first concepts given to the presented feature. It was found that fewer concepts were given and there was less variety in first concepts given for the distinctive features and the most concepts and greater variety of first concepts were given for the high-frequency non-distinctive features. Distinctiveness appears to vary along a continuum, supporting theories of lexical access based on activation and competition between concept words. Additionally, participant age groups were compared for the number of concepts given and the variety of first concepts given. The older adult group produced more concepts and more variety of first concepts than the younger group, in all three feature categories. These results indicate that greater (lifetime) language experience of the participants in the older group was reflected in their performance. A continued interest in semantic features is important to our understanding of the influence of features on the retrieval of semantic concepts and the changes in those retrieval processes over the lifespan.

				"dc:description" : "Student success in online learning is strongly affected by the learner&apos;s social presence. There is evidence that not all students benefit from the online learning environment, as it limits social interaction between the students. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of Twitter, a social network application, on online class engagement. The guiding theories of this study were the constructivist and connectivist theories. The research question examined the effect of Twitter usage on academic performance, as measured by course grade, and engagement level. This quasi-experimental posttest design study used a convenience sample of 116 students at an urban community college. The treatment group (n = 44) and comparison group (n = 72) students were enrolled in an online classroom. The treatment group also integrated the non-formal use of Twitter. The survey data were analyzed using multiple linear regression. The main independent variables, quantity of tweets (r = 0.20, p = 0.20) and quality of tweets (r = 0.12 p = 0.43), were not statistically correlated with academic performance. Differences between the groups on academic performance were not statistically significant (t (72.75) = 1.38, p = 0.17). However, students in the treatment group who self-reported that the tweets increased their level of engagement, also self-reported a higher final grade average (M = 88.18, SD = 9.405). Implications for positive social change include information that can be used to inform instructors for creating an ungraded, informal environment which will make their online classes more engaging, increase the dialogue between the students and the instructor, and ultimately improve the learners&apos; success in online classes.

				"dc:description" : "The purpose of this study was to explore how Namibian high school teachers experienced the ICT policy for education in their schools. This mixed methods sequential explanatory design consists of two distinct phases: quantitative followed by qualitative (Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2011). Quantitative data collection involved the distribution and collecting of questionnaires across the country and to all high schools. A total of 40% of the high school teachers responded to the survey. Qualitative data included purposeful sample interviews with eight high school teachers and their principals and classroom observations of these teachers. Results reveal that teachers are at an early developmental stage of technology use. Moreover, teachers' use of technology for teaching and learning reflect a rudimentary understanding of the overall policy goals. The creation and implementation of the technology policy clearly highlights that teacher's classroom and school context were not taken into account. Data points to limited support to teachers for implementation and lack of institutional readiness. The data findings support the need to develop more cohesiveness between policy and implementation.

				"dc:description" : "Problem-based learning (PBL) has been embraced by several veterinary colleges as one approach to manage the ever-growing body of knowledge in the profession. The goal is to foster the development of problem-solving and critical thinking skills in students, enabling them to make logical and informed decisions, rather than rely on the rote memorization of facts. PBL comes in many different forms, which causes difficulties with making inferences on student learning and the development of these thinking skills. Moreover, there are a range of possible reasons why and how PBL is implemented i.e. the decision how to implement PBL is dependent on a variety of factors. This qualitative study utilized the concepts of Situated Perspective Theory (Bruce, 1993) and Academic Plans (Stark &amp; Lattuca, 2009) to better understand the contextual, historical, and contingent reasons for the specific manner in which PBL was implemented in the veterinary courses at Michigan State University's College of Veterinary Medicine. Data was collected using semi-structured interviews with instructors that are actively using PBL in their courses. The goal of this study was to develop a rich description of which instructors have integrated PBL into their courses, the specific forms of PBL that were being utilized, and to explore the unique factors in each course that influenced PBL adoption and evolution. This study contributes to the current literature on the use of PBL in veterinary education in specific (and to the application of PBL to professional education, in general) by expanding the manner in which we think about PBL and the contexts of its implementation, thereby informing instructional decision making by instructors and other faculty groups working in institutions of higher education. The results of this study indicate a high degree of variation in PBL implementation at the College, and the absence of a single, unified approach for using this method. Despite faculty perceptions that it is an effective instructional tool, this study indicated a lack of standardized methods for accurately measuring the true impact of PBL.

				"dc:description" : "The purpose of this study was to explore, with eleven Black women leaders in higher education, their perception of spirituality and its impact on their career development. A purposive sample of Black women leaders at research-intensive institutions along the Eastern seaboard was examined in order to understand: (1) How do participants define &quot;spirituality&quot;? (2) How do Black women leaders in academia describe their &quot;spirituality and career development journey&quot;? (3) How do they use their spirituality in their respective leadership role(s)? (4) What, if any, is the perceived connection between spirituality and career development? The study utilized an explanatory qualitative study, while privileging a phenomenological orientation. Participants completed a survey, an in-person interview, and participated in a focus group meeting (Sister Circle) that further examined their experiences. A Womanist spirituality epistemology was used to better understand the participants' narratives, juxtaposed with three elements of Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT). This epistemological structuring resulted in data that showed dichotomous definitions of spirituality; four common external environmental factors as experienced by the participants; and identification of seven spiritual activities used to impact overt behaviors within the workplace. These data resulted in the inference of seven career-enhancing activities/competencies that these leaders utilized in advancing their careers in academe: (1) &quot;Professional Forecasting,&quot; (2) &quot;Professional Maturity,&quot; (3) &quot;Political Savviness,&quot; (4) &quot;Career Decision-Making,&quot; (5) &quot;Mentoring,&quot; (6) &quot;Enhanced Work Performance,&quot; and (7) &quot;Personal Evidence/Professional Presence.&quot; The study concludes with recommendations for future research and practice for college counseling services and similar groups within the helping professions.

				"dc:description" : "Student engagement is a term that is loosely used throughout education and it is defined differently in the various stages of education. This study sought to find factors that predict student engagement for first-generation community college students using secondary data from the Community College Survey of Student Engagement (CCSSE). Using the two components of student engagement established by Kuh et al. (2005) and the definition of social capital by Portes (1998), data was analyzed using hierarchical multiple regression in four blocks to determine which independent variable positively contributes to first-generation college student engagement. This study defined engagement by using two of the five CCSSE benchmarks of student engagement: college support for learners and student-faculty interaction. The sample used for this study included students who participated in the 2008 CCSSE Cohort and indicated that the highest level of education received by their mother or father was high school diploma or GED. The expected results of this study revealed that background characteristics, the quality of on-campus relationships, and use of student services positively predict the engagement of first-generation community college student. On the other hand, this study has revealed that support from family contributes less than the support of friends in the engagement of first-generation community college students. This unanticipated result warrants further studies on the contribution of family support for first-generation college students.

With over 5.5 million college students taking online courses, 29% of college students are taking an online course. As student numbers taking online courses have increased, so have the number of faculty teaching online. The purpose of this study is to determine if and how community college, online, faculty are administratively evaluated. The Chief Academic Officer (CAO) of the members of the American Association of Community Colleges were surveyed to determine the factors considered relevant for online, asynchronous, administrative evaluation of faculty that are currently being used by community colleges and to determine the methods by which community college, online faculty are administratively evaluated. The literature review did not identify any research directly related to the administrative evaluation of community college, online faculty. A very limited amount of research on administrative evaluation of faculty was identified, but nearly all were over a decade old. The survey results indicate that a majority of community colleges do not specifically address evaluation of online faculty in policy. The results identify the criteria and methods used to evaluate online faculty and their rated importance. The most common criteria included in the evaluations were identified and their importance ranked by CAO&apos;s. The data was analyzed by institutional size based on the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) categories and contrasted and compared with the other institutional size categories. A proposed model/method for developing a comprehensive faculty evaluation system based the survey results and best practices from the literature review is presented along with recommendations for further research.

				"dc:description" : "Community colleges in the state of Missouri began to offer a two-year degree known as the Associate of Arts in Teaching (AAT) in 2007. Because this was a new degree for the state and only a few other states in the nation offered the degree, community colleges in Missouri were eager to measure the efficacy of the degree. The purpose of this mixed-method study was to determine if AAT graduates from this Midwestern community college were successful when they transferred to a four-year institution to continue their education and complete a baccalaureate degree. The participants of this study were AAT completers and the cooperating teachers who hosted them during their clinical field experience. Additional grade point information was provided by the three primary receiving transfer institutions. The independent variable was the completion of an AAT program. The qualitative components were the AAT completers' and cooperating teachers' perceptions collected via mail survey of students in the AAT program. The quantitative dependent variables were the AAT completers' attainment of higher than a 2.5 grade point average on a 4.0 scale after the completion of the first semester of transfer to a baccalaureate institution and the achievement of higher than a 2.5 GPA on a 4.0 scale during the culminating clinical student teaching experience at the baccalaureate institution. The final dependent variable was the rating by both AAT completers and their host teachers on surveys where they rated their satisfaction with AAT preparation based upon the eleven Missouri Standards for Teacher Education Programs (MoSTEP) using a 4-point Likert scale. The investigational methodology utilized was a positive one-sample, one-tail t-test with a confidence interval of 95 percent. The research contained multiple data sets of both qualitative and quantitative data, and all data supported the hypothesis that the AAT had a positive impact on successful transfer of AAT graduates to four-year institutions. Implications from this study suggested that the AAT is a beneficial degree for community colleges to offer, and community colleges in other states could benefit from the data acquired in completion of this study. Partnerships between two and four-year institutions in teacher education have become increasingly more common, and the AAT ensures a standardization of the component of the educational program offered at the community college level.

				"dc:description" : "Research on teaching, and research about secondary English teachers in particular, has focused on classroom practice. This focus implicitly devalues knowledges beyond those related to classroom practice, and re/produces a public/private divide in the subjectivities of teachers in which &quot;teacher identity&quot; and &quot;teacher knowledge&quot; are considered discrete entities. In this study, I draw on poststructuralist and feminist poststructuralist theories, relying specifically on notions of power-knowledge, discourse, and performativity (Butler, 1990), to inform a conception of subjectivities and knowledges as contingent, intersecting, and re/produced in tandem. During this qualitative study, six secondary English teachers participated in three individual, semi-structured interviews and one focus group over the course of an academic semester. All participants were members of the same department in a large, northeastern, &quot;urban/suburban&quot; high school under corrective action by the state. I interpreted participants&apos; narratives, derived from interview transcripts and conceptualized as performative re/productions of subjectivities and knowledges, in relation to dominant discourses around teaching and the discipline of English in the school context. One participant, a teacher of several remedial courses, participated in interrelated discourses of neoliberalism, accountability, and merit, through which she re/constructed English as a set of skills necessary for &quot;success,&quot; defined in neoliberal terms of individual responsibility, competition, and survival. Two participants, teachers of honors-level courses, re/constructed English as an intellectually elevated pursuit and re/produced autonomous, stoic, hegemonic masculinities through which they positioned themselves as isolated from accountability practices and the feminized histories of teaching and English. Participants&apos; negotiations of subject positions effected costs--psychic and material consequences--including vulnerability, alienation, silencing, and mis/recognition. While participants&apos; narratives re/produced power and gender hierarchies, specifically in relation to teaching and English, their narratives suggest possibilities for subverting such hierarchical norms by engaging teachers in reflexive and autobiographical work that considers subjectivities and knowledges to be fluid, shifting, and partial. The narratives generated for this study raise new questions about the ways in which teachers&apos; subjectivities and knowledge are regulated with/in and by the discourses around the particular academic disciplines and courses they teach, and what assumptions about youth, teachers, and knowledge are embedded in those discursive contexts.

This study explored how high schools and community colleges can work in partnership to improve the transition for first-gen students of color. A mixed-methods analysis aimed to first discern high school students&apos; perceptions before their transition to college, while the secondary qualitative phase uncovered community college students&apos; perceptions after their transition from high school to college. Findings describe portraits of students at four &quot;loss points,&quot; that is, missed opportunities where many underrepresented students are lost to the system of higher education. An integration of quantitative and qualitative findings demonstrated that the first-gen underrepresented students do not have the same access to home- or school-based cultural capital with respect to crucial details and support to make the transition to college, even as compared to their first-gen White and Asian counterparts. Additionally, the high schools are promoting four-year institutions over community colleges, despite that the largest majority of first-gen students of color cannot access four-year colleges. Recommendations outline ways in which high schools and community colleges can best collaborate to shift this inequity by forming strategic partnerships, making data-driving decisions, engaging all students in the community college application process, and encouraging priority enrollment at community colleges for local students.

As unconventional as this educational method may appear, the practice of educating children at home is one alternative to charter, public, private, or parochial school that has increased in its appeal in the African American community. To date, there are no large-scale longitudinal, empirical, or qualitative studies about the thousands of African American homeschoolers. The study by Fields-Smith &amp; Williams (2009), found race, religion and home-school interactions as reasons for electing homeschooling. According to African American parents in this study, race, religion, culture, and teacher&apos;s low expectations are the most common reasons for opting to homeschool.

Brouwer and Errett Bishop. This presentation will compare the classical statements to the constructivized statements. The method focuses on giving numerical meaning to some of the classical calculus statements such as functions, limits, continuity, derivatives, Definite Integral, and The Fundamental Theorem of calculus. The process is referred to as constructivizing calculus statements. The advantage of this process is giving calculus rigor and a more realistic meaning rather than an idealistic meaning. In addition, the calculus becomes more accessible to students in engineering, the sciences, computer technology, and business. Because students in these fields use calculus as a tool, the constructive calculus course meet their needs.

				"dc:description" : "How students labeled as learning disabled (LD) cope with standardization in their schools is mostly a mystery, as is the broader question of how such persons adapt throughout their lives. Participant observation research methodology involved daily observing and interviewing labeled students (6 boys and 4 girls) over nearly one whole academic year about their academic and social experiences in school. School adults (their teachers, principals, and guidance counselor) were also interviewed. Findings are that about two-thirds of the obstacles the labeled students faced were negative academic experiences (e.g., teachers ignoring their learning needs, overly difficult curricular content, boring tasks, and vague directions on assignments from teachers). The other one-third of the obstacles came mainly from negative social experiences: peers and teachers ignoring and bullying them. The teachers and peers only relatively scarcely interacted positively (e.g., tutored them, showed affection, and accepted help). Merely a handful of positive obstacles were identified (i.e., facing challenging, but doable, gratifying academic experiences). The overall frequency of coping students used was withdrawal coping (disengaging) the most, then problem-focused coping, and then rationalization. Better students used problem-focused coping the most, withdrawal, and then rationalization coping. Weaker students used withdrawal the most, problem-focused coping, and then rationalization. Better students used more problem-focused than withdrawal coping and vice versa was the case among the weaker students. Better students used more mature coping mechanisms (e.g., sublimation and humor) and immature mechanisms more harmlessly than weaker students, who used more immature coping mechanisms (e.g., rationalization, acting out, and self-blame) more harmfully. Between the two groups of better and weaker students, the better students were comparatively better in their coping in the social domain than the academic one of school life. The LD program controlled the labeled students rather than provide them with tailored instruction and emotional support. The labeled students led lonely, abused lives--being mostly ignored and bullied or punished by their peers and their teachers. The ultimate necessity of incorporating the burgeoning response to intervention (RTI) system of tiered instruction is suggested as a way of providing specialized, intensive instruction to students labeled as disabled to help them cope better. The study also concludes that interrogating disablism as a material, bodily experience of oppression is needed to explore and adopt different, more inclusive ways of interacting with difference.

				"dc:description" : "This study examined the additive benefit of parent dialogic reading techniques in older, high-risk preschool children using multiple baseline design across participants, a single subject research design, as was as well as pre-test and post-test measures. Five preschoolers age-eligible to begin kindergarten the following school year participated. The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Fourth Edition (PPVT-4) and Expressive Vocabulary Test, Second Edition (EVT-2) were administered pre-intervention and post-intervention implementation. Consistent with multiple baseline design, all students received weekly progress monitoring using the Picture Naming (PN) Individual Growth and Development Indicator (IGDI) throughout the entire investigation. Caregivers received in-person video-based training in dialogic reading techniques. They were then directed to implement dialogic reading strategies within their homes when reading with their children a minimum of three times per week for fifteen minutes per session over a six-week intervention period. It was hypothesized that children receiving home-based dialogic reading support would demonstrate greater expressive and receptive vocabulary skills than those participating in preschool program alone. Visual analysis of graphic data within conditions and between adjacent conditions was utilized to analyze the research questions. Results of the study supported the hypotheses but did not confirm them. Children who received home-based dialogic reading support demonstrated expressive and receptive vocabulary skill growth but no abrupt change occurred immediately after introducing the dialogic reading intervention.

States use various evaluation instruments and current trends across the United States show that more states are working to tie teacher evaluation to student performance. The purpose of this study was to determine to what extent there was interrater reliability among elementary principals in a large, urban district using the North Carolina Teacher Evaluation Process to rate classroom teachers. Four randomly selected teachers were videotaped while teaching a lesson of their choice. Thirty-nine randomly selected elementary principals rated each teacher and answered eight questions on a survey regarding their ratings. Levels of agreement among raters were calculated using Randolph's kappa coefficient. Recommendations were presented for increasing reliability among principals to create a more equitable evaluation process for all teachers.

				"dc:description" : "Visual texts, such as photographs, paintings, film, political cartoons, maps, charts, and graphs are important resources used for a variety of purposes in the history classroom. Aligning instructional use of visual texts to key developmental skills within the area of historical thinking should be a central concern to teachers of historical content. The core of this study centers on intersections between historical understanding and visual texts and the ways in which veteran teachers negotiate these crossroads. The study centers on a professional development workshop series that was held at a small university in upstate New York and the related experiences of three veteran teachers that attended. The central question of the study was: How do teachers define, use and reflect upon their use of visual texts as an instructional source toward the development of their students' historical understanding? Teachers shared their understanding of visual texts as historical resources in light of theoretical models of cognition as well as state and professional standards and assessments. Results of the study indicate that while teachers tend to resist educational theories, they remain open to ideas embedded within those theories--given interpretative explanations and opportunities to, as Dewey has termed, &quot;psychologize&quot; within their own teaching context. Participants indicated visual texts provide increased interest and motivation and allow for a variety of opportunities to differentiate history instruction. Teachers' concerns centered on the development of student understanding of content and context, use of imagination, the incorporation of visual texts to support written and verbal texts, the challenge in developing chronological frameworks, and the facilitation of student analyses of point of view, empathy, and bias. The study concludes with educational implications regarding the use of visual texts toward the development of students' historical thinking skills. Analyses are presented to augment current thinking about pedagogical content knowledge and represent a contribution to the literature connecting visual texts, historical thinking, and multimodal/multiliteracy design. Also discussed are the roles of teachers as theorizers and the potential impact on visual text use toward historical understanding in light of Common Core State Standards.

				"dc:description" : "Registered nurses (RNs) who make the move from a patient-care service setting to an academic teaching environment often go through a transition phase in their first semesters of teaching that is difficult and traumatic. RNs that go on to higher academic degrees often do so in order to teach in schools of nursing. However, graduate work in nursing does not routinely prepare the RN on the basic concepts of teaching adults. The purpose of this qualitative study is to (a) explore the experience of transitioning from service settings to academia for RNs who have 5 years or less of academic teaching experience and (b) propose a project to assist in this transition. The study used transition theory as its theoretical framework. Two guiding questions explored the experience of expert RNs moving from the service of patients to an academic setting and the preparation needed to support this transition. Data analysis was conducted using coding methods, member checking, and cross-referencing to pre-existing data sources from the university. Semi structured face-to-face interviews of 17 eligible faculty were coded for common words and themes. The themes were cross tabulated to 5 years of historical university data in order to build a chain of support for developing evidence. The results of the study interviews revealed four themes: unprepared for the academic setting, a general lack of support from the university, an overall feeling of accomplishment, and a requests for a mentoring program based on level of need. The findings from the interviews guided the project development of a formal mentoring program that supports professionals, who are expert in their field, to transition successfully into academics. Implications for positive social change include increased faculty satisfaction and retention. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

				"dc:description" : "As the amount of information available in online digital libraries increases exponentially, questions arise concerning the most productive way to use that information to advance learning. Applying the earlier information seeking theories advocated by Kelly (1963), Taylor (1968), and Belkin (1980) to the digital libraries experience, Carol Kuhlthau created the inquiry-based information search process (ISP) model. This ISP model describes thoughts, actions and feelings in six stages of inquiry: initiation, selection, exploration, formulation, collection, and presentation. This study investigated the value of an organized educational digital library in supporting and improving English Foreign Language (EFL) student's critical thinking skills. The study also considered if critical thinking skills and English language skills can be improved simultaneously in the appropriate learning environment. A quasi-experimental pretest/posttest design was utilized. Participants were 98 Taiwanese freshmen majoring in Applied English. Two groups were compared in their ability to cultivate critical thinking. One approach used traditional open access to information plus training in critical thinking. The other used a structured approach to accessing and organizing information from an online digital library as well as training in critical thinking. A One-Way ANCOVA and an Independent-Samples t-test were used to examine the two groups on their 1) critical thinking skills, 2) English reading comprehension, and 3) attitudes in EFL classrooms. Bivariate correlation was employed to evaluate the relation between critical thinking and English reading comprehension. Results indicated that the experimental digital library group (M = 11.69) significantly outperformed the traditional group (M = 10.61) in critical thinking; F (1, 95) = 4.10, p &lt; 0.05. The digital library group (M = 11.69) also outperformed the traditional group (M = 10.23) on English reading comprehension; F (1, 95) = 14.72, p &lt; 0.05. There was a positive relationship between critical thinking and English reading comprehension (r = 0.212), p &lt; 0.05. Also, students in the digital library group (M = 38.57), had better learning attitudes toward the intervention training program than did the control group (M = 35.59); t (96) = 2.48, p &lt; 0.05. Students who used structured search strategies with digital libraries had higher critical thinking performance and more positive attitudes toward their learning experience. Educators should adopt training strategies that engage learners in every stage of inquiry process, from identifying a topic and selecting what to investigate, to formulating a focused perspective and presenting their final product. Further studies are needed to determine if the benefits of structured search strategies with digital libraries extends to other settings, cultures and grade levels. Collecting and analyzing examples of student projects may provide additional insights into the development of critical thinking skills.

				"dc:description" : "The purpose of this study was to investigate the frequency of the best teaching practices (Small Group, Reading as Thinking, Representing to Learn, Classroom Workshop, Authentic Experiences, Reflective Assessment, and Integrative Units) and compare the difference between the structures and demographic variables (program size, student-teacher ratio, program location, gender of director, educational degree of director, administrative license status, and years of experience of the director) according to Zemelman, Daniels, and Hyde (2005) within the ALE programs in the state of Arkansas. ALE directors were surveyed using a self-administered questionnaire during January 2011. The results of 108 directors were analyzed to determine the structures' frequency of implementation using means, standard deviations, and ranges. Five separate ANOVAs and two T-Tests were used to compare the effect of the variables to the structures. Directors reported the most utilized structure was Reading as Thinking, and the least utilized was Integrated Units. However, the difference was small and all structures were used occasionally. Directors also reported there was no main effect significant between the structures based upon the variables of program size, location, and director's level of degree. However, directors with higher student-teacher ratios, between 11 and 38 to one, are more likely to report the activities of Authentic Experiences rather than directors with the lower student-teacher ratios between one and five to one. Female directors were more likely than male directors to report the activities of Small Groups, Reading as Thinking, and Representing to Learn. Directors without an administrative license are more likely to report activities of Authentic Experiences than directors holding an administrative license. Directors with seven to twenty years of experience are more likely to report the activities of Reading as Thinking and Representing to Learn rather than directors of experience of one to two years. Directors with three to twenty years of experience are more likely to report the activities of Classroom Workshop rather than directors of experience of one to two years.

				"dc:description" : "The purpose of this study was to investigate how writing in mathematics is treated in one 4th grade National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded mathematics textbook titled &quot;Everyday Mathematics&quot; and one publisher-generated textbook titled &quot;enVision MATH.&quot; The developed framework provided categories to support each of the research questions. The results indicate that writing is supported in both traditional and NSF developed 4th grade mathematics textbooks. Results also indicated the number of exercises and writing prompts was higher in the &quot;enVision MATH&quot; textbook. However, &quot;Everyday Mathematics&quot; had a higher percentage of exercises that were coded as writing prompts. The framework domains of &quot;content strand&quot; in &quot;enVision MATH&quot; and &quot;Everyday Mathematics&quot; are similar in percentages with the exception of prompts coded in the other category. &quot;Everyday Mathematics&quot; appeared to be the only textbook analyzed to support writing across different content areas. Furthermore, the content strand of &quot;number sense&quot; had the largest percentage of writing prompts coded between both textbook series. Other findings from this study suggest that the type of vocabulary coded within the writing prompts was similar in all categories between both textbook series analyzed. Additionally, vocabulary specific to the domain of mathematics and symbols appeared to have the largest percentage in this category for both textbook series. The teacher and student editions were explored in &quot;enVision MATH&quot; and &quot;Everyday Mathematics&quot; to provide more depth to the research. An exploration of the teacher edition indicated how writing was supported for instructional purposes. The teacher editions in both textbook series had the largest percentage of support in the form of one sample response. Within the &quot;student edition&quot; category, the layout varied in the &quot;enVision MATH&quot; and &quot;Everyday Mathematics&quot; textbook series. As a result, only the language of &quot;Everyday MATH&quot; could be analyzed for patterns in the &quot;sections,&quot; &quot;sub-sections,&quot; and &quot;additional sub-sections&quot; of where the prompts were located. Although this investigation did not involve analyzing student responses to the writing prompts, the findings provide information regarding the expectations of the writer in order to construct a mathematical response. For example, the &quot;domain specific vocabulary&quot; (DSV) and &quot;symbols&quot; category was rated the highest in percentage for both textbooks indicating that students will need to have command of the language and symbols of mathematics in order to engage in meaning making written discourse. Because most of the math prompts were specific to the &quot;problem solving&quot; category, it was determined after a linguistic analysis that the affordance of the prompt is much more complex than then binary categories of content and process Additionally, in order for students to respond to these content writing prompts, many process words known as &quot;meta-language&quot; (i.e., explanation, description, why question, how question) need to be comprehended in order for composition to begin. In light of these findings, I recommend that special attention be given to the teacher and student editions regarding the implementation of writing in mathematics. The development of these materials has important implications regarding instruction and learning of mathematical concepts through writing, potentially impacting student performance on national and international assessments.

				"dc:description" : "One program designed to prepare first-generation, low-income, and underrepresented students to transition from high school to college are early college high school programs which allow qualified students to simultaneously obtain high school diplomas and associate's degrees. However, little is known about how students and faculty perceive such programs' strengths, weaknesses, and usefuless. Using self-efficacy and motivation theories as a conceptual framework, this qualitative case study focused on answering this question by exploring the experiences of one group of 15 ECHS graduates and 5 members of their faculty from a school located in Texas. Data sources included an online questionnaire used with 15 graduates of the program and follow-up in-depth interviews with 5 program graduates and 5 teachers. Open, axial, and selective coding were used to triangulate and organize the data into themes and subthemes. The findings revealed (a) success of the graduates involved strong connections with teachers, staff, students, and administrators; (b) resources such as tutoring, counseling, and engaging students are helpful along with guidance for the students while in the program; and (c) teachers' engagement, creativity, trustworthiness, and rigor help cultivate the program. This study facilitates positive social change by providing administrators and educators with knowledge about the key factors in such programs that help students succeed and transition successfully into higher education.

				"dc:description" : "College completion is an issue of great concern in the United States, where only 50% of students who start college as freshmen complete a bachelor's degree at that institution within six years. Researchers have studied a variety of factors to understand their relationship to student persistence. Not surprisingly, student characteristics, particularly their academic background prior to entering college, have a tremendous influence on college success. Colleges and universities have little control over student characteristics unless they screen out lesser qualified students during the admissions process, but selectivity is contrary to the push for increased accessibility for under-served groups. As a result, institutions need to better understand the factors that they can control. High-impact educational practices have been shown to improve retention and persistence through increased student engagement. Service-learning, a pedagogical approach that blends meaningful community service and reflection with course content, is a practice that is increasing in popularity, and it has proven beneficial at increasing student learning and engagement. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether participation in service-learning has any influence in the likelihood of degree completion or time to degree and, secondarily, to compare different methods of analysis to determine whether use of more complex models provides better information or more accurate prediction. The population for this study was a large public urban research institution in the mid-Atlantic region, and the sample was the cohort of students who started as first-time, full-time, bachelor's degree-seeking undergraduates in the fall of 2005. Data included demographic and academic characteristics upon matriculation, as well as financial need and aid, academic major, and progress indicators for each of the first six years of enrollment. Cumulative data were analyzed using logistic regression, and year-to-year data were analyzed using discrete-time survival analysis in a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework. Parameter estimates and odds ratios for the predictors in each model were compared. Some similarities were found in the variables that predict degree completion, but there were also some striking differences. The strongest predictors for degree completion were pre-college academic characteristics and strength of academic progress while in college (credits earned and GPA). When analyzed using logistic regression and cross-sectional data, service-learning participation was not a significant predictor for completion, but it did have an effect on completion time for those students who earned a degree within six years. When analyzed longitudinally using discrete-time survival analysis, however, service-learning participation is strongly predictive of degree completion, particularly when credits are earned in the third, fourth, and sixth years of enrollment. In the survival analysis model, service-learning credits earned were also more significant for predicting degree completion than other credits earned. In terms of data analysis, logistic regression was effective at predicting completion, but survival analysis seems to provide a more robust method for studying specific variables that may vary by time.

				"dc:description" : "&quot;The ability of this nation to provide a growing economy, strong health and human services, and a secure and safe nation depends upon a vibrant, creative, and diverse engineering and science workforce&quot; (Blue, et al., 2005, p.4). To contribute to technological advancements, engage in global collaboration, solve complex problems, encourage a more socially just profession, and respond to the predicted shortage of American engineers, it is necessary for this nation&apos;s engineering workforce and university student bodies to be more diverse in its racial, gender, and socioeconomic (SES) representation. The lack of representation in SES is the focus of this research. The purpose of this qualitative study is to give low-SES first-generation students an opportunity to share their stories about the influences that prompted them to choose to study engineering. The research question this study addresses is: &quot;What are the lived experiences that influenced low-SES first-generation students to pursue engineering study?.&quot; This study used a phenomenological inquiry approach, purposive criterion sampling, and descriptive and topical coding. Interviews were semi-structured, and consisted of open-ended questions. Transcripts were coded to identify general and unique themes that resulted in four assertions. These low-SES first-generation students were influenced to pursue engineering study by 1) elements of engineering experienced in informal learning settings; 2) their self-identified attributes and interests, and their advanced skills; 3) their understanding of the image of the field of engineering; and 4) STEM-knowledgeable individuals who offered encouragement, support, and perspective. These assertions led me to conclude that low-SES first-generation students who make it to college to study engineering are similar to their higher-SES peers, but low-SES students cannot have any other setbacks besides being low-SES and still be successful in engineering. I also observed that these four assertions seem to be related to forms of capital. All of these participants were eager to spend time sharing their story with me. They expressed appreciation that I cared about the influences that affected their journey to engineering and that I wanted to research their lived experiences. I was honored to act as the phenomenologist in understanding the influences on these students in their pursuit of engineering study.

				"dc:description" : "The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of the SuccessMaker (SM) program along with teacher instruction and skill development on the academic performance of fourth grade students. School personnel are searching for efficient and effective means for improving instruction and knowledge. Instructional technology can be very beneficial to improving student achievement. With this awareness and the demands to meet Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP), caused by No Child Left Behind, schools and districts have increased the pressure to find instructional technology applications that advance student learning. Fourth grade students from an elementary school in South Carolina who completed the SM program in the 2009-10 school year were studied. Data was gathered from this year. Descriptive statistics and independent samples t-test were utilized to analyze this data. The population consisted of 90 students who were assigned to coursework in the Reader's Workshop (RW) and Math Concepts and Skills (MCS) courseware in SM. Palmetto Assessment of State Standards (PASS), the state-mandated measurement of AYP, was utilized to measure achievement. A quantitative research method with a simple descriptive research design was employed to answer the research questions and test the hypotheses. The first research question focused on time in the program. The second and third questions examined the combined effects of both RW and MCS on achievement scores. Findings indicated that students who maintained the performance level in SM with 65% or higher for reading and 90% or higher for mathematics scored significantly higher on PASS when compared to students who performed 64% or lower and 89% or lower. However, time in the SM program was not effective in showing an increase in PASS test scores.. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

				"dc:description" : "This qualitative exploratory study investigated practicing and pre-service elementary teachers&apos; representations of the nature of matter and the ways in which those representations were transformed into teaching representations. Seven practicing elementary teachers from a rural elementary school and five pre-service elementary teachers were asked to draw their personal external representations of a sugar cube, wooden toothpick, liquid water, copper wire and a helium balloon. Next, they were asked to draw their personal external representations of properties of the objects and physical processes they can undergo. Then they were asked to draw their personal external teaching representations or describe other methods they would use to teach elementary students about the nature of matter. Each participant was concurrently interviewed about their representations. Analysis of the data was used to build profiles of each participant. In general, results of this study indicated that practicing elementary teachers tended to draw and explain the nature of matter at the macroscopic level both for themselves and for their students. They also tended to focus on how an object was manufactured or human uses of the object rather than providing explanations that described or explained the composition of each object or properties and processes each object could undergo. The pre-service elementary teachers tended to draw molecular representations that described and explained both composition of the objects and their properties and processes. Pre-service elementary teachers also tended to express opinions that elementary students could learn about atoms and molecules whereas practicing elementary teachers tended to view elementary students as concrete learners. Implications for research and teaching will be discussed in Chapter 5 of this dissertation. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

				"dc:description" : "Data centric applications, an important effort of software development in large organizations, have been mostly adopting a software methodology, such as a waterfall or Rational Unified Process, as the framework for its development. These methodologies could work on structural, procedural, or object oriented based applications, but fails to capture the dynamics and dimensions of data centric applications. These methodologies were proven to be unsuccessful because they did not take into consideration all of the aspects of the data components and structures. This raises the question of what method should be used in developing those types of applications. The purpose of this study is to address the essential elements for a successful agile methodology that can effectively address the structure, behavior, and dimensions of a data centric development effort. An example of these dimensions could be the phases that the project goes though, the principles or best practices that are used, or the disciplines that are applied in the project lifecycle. My assumption is that there is a number of common essential elements used in developing and managing data centric applications and could be combined in a formal Systems Development Lifecycle of data centric application.

				"dc:description" : "This mixed methods explanatory study addressed the problem of continuing disparity in achievement between students with special needs and their peers in the educational setting, despite mandates requiring schools to educate these students in the least restrictive environment. The purpose of this study was to determine the types and extent of resources used by general education teachers regarding their special needs students. Constructivism provided the theoretical foundation for the study. The research questions were designed to determine teachers&apos; perceptions of the types and effectiveness of collaboration between general and special education teachers. A nonrandom sample of 49 intermediate general education teachers in a northwestern school district responded to a researcher-developed survey. Data were grouped and analyzed using ANOVA, correlation and chi-square statistical tests to answer each of 5 research questions. Internal consistency reliability analyses were conducted using the survey data. Open-ended responses were thematically coded and results were used to explain findings. Findings showed that direct consultation with a special education teacher was the preferred type of resource, however less than 1 hour per week was actually spent consulting. Teacher collaboration with peers was perceived as effective for improving self-esteem, social skills and interpersonal relationships for students. Recommendations for the district include administrative support for professional development to improve the collaborative process. The findings could affect positive social change when teachers are engaged in improving the learning environment and achievement of students with special needs to facilitate employment opportunities for this group of students.

				"dc:description" : "The open access mission is central to the community college role and mission in higher education. Although initially implemented by four-year colleges and universities, adoption of formal enrollment management initiatives in community colleges is on the increase. Admission, matriculation, retention, and persistence are affected by enrollment management policies. Initiatives designed to control enrollment may alter the open access commitment of the community college by limiting access to some students. Enrollment management practices at the community college can include selective marketing and recruiting practices. This study examined the prevalence of selective marketing and recruiting practices at North Carolina community colleges and the impact of such practices on enrollment. Results of the study indicated that about half of the community colleges in North Carolina practice selective marketing and recruiting practices, although to date those practices have had no apparent impact on the demographic composition of the student body. Student demographic representation in enrollment at North Carolina community colleges was statistically significantly different than the corresponding demographic composition of college service areas. Organizational depth of marketing implementation at selective colleges was compared to the demographic composition of student body enrollment. There was no relationship between organizational depth of marketing implementation at selective colleges and student body demographic composition. Study results inform decisions affecting the use of selective marketing and recruiting practices within the context of the open access mission at the community college. Implications for policy and practice include the recommendation to create an enrollment management division at each community college, to streamline use of the marketing dollar, and to increase the use of marketing to influence the decision-making process of internal stakeholders.

				"dc:description" : "The allocation of quality teachers across schools is of interest because of both the importance and costliness of teachers as inputs in the education production process. Furthermore, because teachers have preferences over their workplace characteristics, this allocation across schools is nonrandom. This research examines teacher mobility within the school system by focusing on the school characteristics that affect the probability of teachers leaving their current schools. Using longitudinal data on public schools in North Carolina, I estimate teacher mobility probabilities using empirical specifications that incorporate current school characteristics, as well as characteristics of other potential schools. I jointly estimate these teacher mobility probabilities with two endogenous teacher credential outcomes. The joint estimation uses a discrete factor random effects method to control for both individual permanent and time-varying unobserved heterogeneity. Results show that changes in student demographics have significant effects on one-year mobility probabilities. These changes in demographics have different effects across teachers of different experience levels, with teachers early in their careers being more sensitive to changes in student characteristics and salary than more experienced teachers. Long run results suggest that providing beginning teachers with preferred school characteristics may result in a substantial increase in the number of these teachers remaining in the public school system after five years.

				"dc:description" : "Early aggression is a problem in its own right and a risk factor for further developmental problems. Although both effortful control and social information processing (SIP) skills are negatively associated with aggression and are targeted by aggression prevention programs, little is known about the relation between them or about their joint relation with aggression. Further, effortful control is often measured poorly in aggression prevention studies. This dissertation reports findings from three studies of effortful control, SIP, and aggression. Data were collected from 691 boys and girls at 10 North Carolina schools during the third and fourth grades (2004-2006). In Study 1, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used with third grade fall data to develop an effortful control scale. In Study 2, generalized estimating equations were used to assess whether, within each grade, SIP variables (measured in winter) mediated the relation between effortful control (fall) and aggression (spring). Similarly, Study 3 assessed whether fourth-grade effortful control and SIP variables (fall and winter, respectively) mediated the effect of the Competence Support Program, a classroom management and social skills training intervention, on aggression. Study 1 resulted in a second-order model (X[superscript 2]/df = 6.41, RMSEA = 0.089 [90% CI: 0.077 to 0.100], CFI = IFI = 0.957), with effortful control explaining the correlations among three factors: inhibitory control (alpha = 0.843), attention control problems (alpha = 0.876), and impulsivity (alpha = 0.885). In Study 2, unadjusted results showed significant indirect effects of effortful control on aggression, mediated by hostile attribution (fourth grade only), goal formulation, and response decision, but not encoding. Adjusted results showed no mediation effects. Study 3 found no effect of the Competence Support Program on mediators or on aggression. Based on a strong theoretical framework and using appropriate statistical methods, Study 1 developed a reliable and valid teacher-reported measure of effortful control; Studies 2 and 3 provided modest support for the theory underlying many aggression prevention programs. Together, the studies resulted in recommendations for improved measurement of effortful control, SIP, and aggression; better use of longitudinal mediation models to assess the relations among them; and improved research on aggression prevention. These studies belong to a body of research that is incrementally improving the prevention of childhood aggression.

				"dc:description" : "Despite the increased promotion of integrated language and content instruction, large gaps in academic achievement persist between English language learners (ELLs) and their English-proficient peers (New York State Education Department, 2011c). In this study, I employ practitioner research methods to investigate ELLs&apos; experiences in an extracurricular science classroom at an International High School. Participants included 10th grade ELLs with diverse first languages (i.e., Bangla, Chinese, French, Italian, Russian, Spanish, Urdu, Uzbek, Vietnamese) who attended a series of extracurricular Saturday science classes taught by myself, an ESL educator. My data comprised mainly of videorecordings documenting ELLs&apos; review of a state-mandated Living Environment lab assignment. The use of situated learning theory as an analytic frame yielded insights undetected when applying a cognitivist lens alone but perceptible when applying sociocultural precepts that regard &quot;language&quot; and &quot;content&quot; as inseparable and learning as &quot;apprenticeship into particular communities of practice.&quot; In my analysis, the &quot;language&quot; and &quot;content&quot; emerging from this classroom was re-characterized as discourse and then described in terms of the alignment with practices of &quot;disciplinary science&quot; or &quot;school science,&quot; and in some instances, both. This account contributes empirical support for the relationship theorized to exist between &quot;language&quot; and &quot;content&quot; (Barwell, 2005). Findings also suggest that science classroom discourse encountered and practiced by ELLs can be more generally characterized as approximating the practices of &quot;disciplinary science&quot; or exemplifying those of &quot;school science,&quot; and more specifically described in relation to the &quot;need for speed,&quot; &quot;the place for ambiguity,&quot; &quot;the locus of authority,&quot; &quot;the role of social interaction,&quot; and &quot;the object of reproduction.&quot; This portrayal of ELLs&apos; academic experiences (a) departs from research and pedagogy critiqued for their limitations associated with deficit views imposed on immigrant youth (Rolstad, 2005), cognitivist assumptions about learning as simply &quot;language acquisition&quot; or &quot;knowledge transmission&quot; (Walqui, 2002), and privileging of verbocentric forms of academic participation (Siegel, 1995); and (b) motivates re-interpretations of academic classroom practices of ELLs and their educators.

				"dc:description" : "This dissertation is a phenomenological case study of two 12th grade English/language arts (ELA) classrooms where teachers used graphic novels with their advanced students. The primary purpose of this case study was to gain insight into the phenomenon of using graphic novels with these students--a research area that is currently limited. Literature from a variety of disciplines was compared and contrasted with observations, interviews, questionnaires, and structured think-aloud activities for this purpose. The following questions guided the study: (1) What are the prevailing attitudes/opinions held by the ELA teachers who use graphic novels and their students about this medium? (2) What interests do the students have that connect to the phenomenon of comic book/graphic novel reading? (3) How do the teachers and the students make meaning from graphic novels? The findings generally affirmed previous scholarship that the medium of comic books/graphic novels can play a beneficial role in ELA classrooms, encouraging student involvement and ownership of texts and their visual literacy development. The findings also confirmed, however, that teachers must first conceive of literacy as more than just reading and writing phonetic texts if the use of the medium is to be more than just secondary to traditional literacy. The findings also affirmed that a complex interaction of pedagogy, curriculum, and historical influences inform, affect, and shape this phenomenon and create tensions around the use of this medium, particularly for students. The study also produced some interesting findings that complicated and even challenged current scholarship about the canon, literacy, and using comic books/graphic novels in the ELA classroom. While it is understood that canonical texts often persist due to social and cultural forces that influence both schooling and our society, there are also less controlling forces influencing the canon, particularly nostalgia. The findings also suggest that excellent traditional literacy abilities can play an important role in understanding and interpreting images; however, instruction in the arts and visual literacy can augment and deepen students&apos; visual literacy. Finally, the findings suggest that scholarship on comic books, particularly how to read them, may be overly complicated and pedantic.

				"dc:description" : "This qualitative case study was designed to explore how master teachers in transfer high schools learn the competencies they perceive are required to engage at-risk students so that they persist and graduate. The study is based on the following assumptions: (1) The requisite teacher competencies can be defined and identified and, in fact, strengthened. (2) Organizational context matters. School organizations that are most successful at the task of helping at-risk students graduate are the ones where the systems, structure, organizational culture, leadership, climate, and resources support the development of teaching competencies required to help students graduate. The sites for this study were nine transfer high schools located on the East Coast of the United States. The primary sources of data were: in-depth interviews involving thirteen teachers and ten principals and assistant principals in nine alternative high school settings, document analysis, and unobtrusive observation of classes. The study was framed by three theoretical frameworks: (1) self-efficacy beliefs as a motivating factor for teachers who choose to teach in alternative schools for at-risk youth (Bandura, 1989, 1993, 1997). This theoretical framework is rooted in social-cognitive theory of human behavior. (2) Adult learning theories, specifically, experiential learning. This study set out to examine how the study participants learned the competencies required to engage at-risk youth. One key finding was that participants learned both through the attainment of formal academic credentials and professional development as well as informally through dialogue with other teachers. Furthermore, several competencies were identified by participants as requirements for the successful engagement of students: (1) the ability to build relationships; (2) the ability to know what and how to teach; and (3) the ability to overcome school challenges. The principal recommendation resulting from the study is that teachers, principals, and assistant principals focus on building communities of practice. Communities engaged in inquiry and dialogue may enhance teacher self-efficacy beliefs and the development of the kinds of competencies that lead to student engagement and retention.

				"dc:description" : "This study examined the institution-building efforts of a leading charter school management organization, Achievement First. The study used a conceptual framework derived from institutional theory in sociology that offers two competing policy contexts in which charter schools and charter management organizations operate--a bureaucratic versus decentralized frame. As charter school leaders pursue new and different forms of schooling within a decentralized policy frame, they are challenged by well-established bureaucratic rules and norms that define what it means to be a legitimate school and that exert isomorphic pressures on newly created charter organizations to conform to normative definitions of schooling. Micro-level institution-building efforts, however, represent viable alternatives to the institutional order of public education, as charter school leaders attempt to achieve scale of their school models through charter management organizations. Findings from this study indicate that while macro-institutional forces constrain charter school management organization behavior, local actors respond strategically at the micro-level in ways that thwart isomorphism and allow the charter management organization to build to scale.

				"dc:description" : "Greater academic pressures have been placed on rural schools to provide effective learning that will allow students to fulfill high school graduation requirements and prepare for entry into post-secondary institutions. Rural schools are confronted with many problematic issues including remote locations, limited resources, and shortage of qualified teachers. To relieve academic pressures, many rural secondary schools are turning to distance education as a solution. Distance education satisfaction of rural school districts that are currently using Web-based online curriculum may be premature. Although asynchronous Web-based online classes can provide rural secondary students with required graduation courses or advanced classes, the effectiveness of the online modality may be lacking. Most secondary students have not acquired motivational and time management skills and the maturity necessary to successfully learn in an independent asynchronous online environment. Although rural school districts seem to be satisfied with merely filling academic course shortages, few research studies have been conducted to provide guidelines for determining the quality and effectiveness of the distance learning courses. A relatively new distance learning delivery method used within rural secondary education is digital Interactive Television (ITv). The instructional objective of ITv is to provide a better delivery format for interaction and synchronous communication between the instructor and the learner, regardless of location. Remote and rural learners interact synchronously through audio and visual technologies, combining all locations simultaneously to extend a traditional classroom environment. The purpose was to conduct an in-depth case study to investigate the effect of ITv on student motivation, achievement and anxiety in four selected public rural secondary schools. The primary objective was to determine if ITv used in rural secondary schools affected student achievement. The findings revealed that motivation and anxiety had no effect on achievement for the students enrolled in ITv courses. The participants were comfortable using ITv, similar to a traditional classroom, and no stressful detractions occurred which allowed for positive learning to take place and above average academic scores. Unlike Web-based online courses, students felt that the immediate live assistance was available as needed during the ITv class and that their academic scores would be better.

This study identified the stages, people, processes, and tools that were essential to build the research infrastructure to support the project's goal. The primary research question explored in this study was: What role did technological resources play in the development of a national research project?. This single case study, based on publicly available documents about the project, described the evolution of the technology-based research tools for the purpose of supporting a national, multi-component, longitudinal research study. The research in this case study documented how the steps followed during the initiation phase led to the development of technological solutions to support data collection in the implementation phase. A key finding of the analysis was how the growing capacity for technology development ultimately contributed to the development of technological tools, which in turn supported the overall project. This case study concluded with a reflection on the potential of this project and a discussion of the role technology played as one aspect of building the capacity of the project to contribute to Ireland's ability to develop a &quot;knowledge-based&quot; economy.

				"dc:description" : "Retaining qualified teachers in America&apos;s schools is one of the nation&apos;s challenges in education. Current research revealed teacher turnover had risen to 16.9% nationally, which equates to 2.7 million teachers, including 2.1 million who left the profession before retirement. In order to make a positive change in teacher retention, teacher perceptions of needs that lead to job satisfaction needed to be investigated. This sequential, explanatory, mixed-method study was conducted in a public school district to investigate the factors that lead to teacher job satisfaction. The research questions explored elementary teachers&apos; perceptions of organizational, monetary, and support factors using a preexisting, 5-point, Likert-scaled questionnaire and six semistructured interviews. The survey responses were analyzed descriptively to understand the factors leading to job satisfaction. Interview data were coded through the interpretive approach and themes were distinguished to gain further explanation of the quantitative data. The findings from this study indicated teachers perceived collegial support, principal support, class size, expectations, discipline issues, benefits, professional development, and salary as significant factors that affected teacher job satisfaction and retention decisions. As a result, a professional learning community action plan was developed to improve teacher job satisfaction and retention decisions. Implications for positive social change include the recognition of needs and perceptions of teachers in order to improve job satisfaction, retain teachers, and positively affect student achievement.

This study also sought to examine the sources of information that parents used. Also examined was the impact of socio-economic status in the high school selection process. A survey was administered to a convenience sample of parents attending Choice Open Houses at high schools in a school district in Delaware in November, 2008. Telephone interviews were conducted at a later date with a group of volunteers who had completed the survey and indicated they were willing to talk further about the process of high school selection in their family. Survey data showed that the most important factors influencing the selection of a high school for parents were academic factors. Telephone interviews revealed the important role that safety factors played in the choice process. Safety issues were viewed as prerequisites for selecting schools by parents who were engaged in the school choice process. Survey data showed that official sources of information were rated by parents as being most important to them. Telephone interviews revealed the important role of informal sources of information. The interviews also revealed that parents view the school choice process as high stakes and stressful. The study found that parents with more education were more likely to participate in the school choice process. The study also found low participation rates by the following subgroups: participants in the Free and Reduced Price Meal Program, parents of special education students, and participants in the English Language Learner program.

				"dc:description" : "Semantic Minimalism is a position about the semantic content of declarative sentences, i.e., the content that is determined entirely by syntax. It is defined by the following two points: &quot;Point 1&quot;: The semantic content is a complete/truth-conditional proposition. &quot;Point 2&quot;: The semantic content is useful to a theory of utterance interpretation. Against this position, Contextualists present two main arguments: &quot;Incompleteness Problem&quot;: For some sentences, semantic interpretation gives us a propositional radical. &quot;Inaccessibility Problem&quot;: For some sentences, semantic interpretation gives us a proposition that is complete/truth-conditional but not consciously accessible. The Incompleteness Problem, an argument against Point 1, claims that the semantic content of a sentence like &quot;Tipper is ready&quot; expresses a propositional radical that requires a completion specifying what Tipper is ready for to express a complete proposition. Since this completion is pragmatically determined, Contextualists argue that semantic interpretation alone sometimes fails to determine a content that is complete/truth-conditional. The Inaccessibility Problem, an argument against Point 2, claims that the semantic content of a sentence like &quot;Jack and Jill are married,&quot; i.e., &quot;Jack and Jill are each married,&quot; is oftentimes consciously inaccessible; what is accessible is the pragmatically determined proposition that &quot;Jack and Jill are married to each other.&quot; Contextualists argue that in such cases, the semantic content fails to play any role in explaining communicative success. My aim in this dissertation is to endorse a version of Minimalism by defending Point 1 and Point 2 against these two arguments. In Chapter 1, I put the disagreement between Minimalists and Contextualists in clearer focus by separating it from another disagreement concerning the notion of saying. In Chapter 2, I defend Point 1 by arguing that the Minimalist view that I favor, according to which the semantic content of a sentence like &quot;Tipper is ready&quot; is a complete/truth-conditional, albeit unspecific, proposition, is a more reasonable view than Contextualism. In Chapter 3, I defend Point 2 by showing the plausibility of the idea that the semantic content of a sentence like &quot;Jack and Jill are married&quot; plays the input role in a speedy subconscious process that &quot;mirrors&quot; the Gricean implicature process.

				"dc:description" : "Modern information technologies have transformed the meaning and promise of &quot;open government.&quot; The term originally stood for the ideas of government transparency and public accountability. But with the rise of the Internet, &quot;open government&quot; has grown to encompass a wide range of civic goals--greater public participation and increased government efficiency, among others--newly enhanced by the potential of digital technologies. Software now plays a key mediating role between governments and citizens, and the design of software can both inform and shape the effectiveness of open government policies. In this dissertation, we explore government&apos;s role as an information provider in the digital age. Rather than struggling, as it currently does, to keep up with the rapid pace of technological change, we contend that government should focus on enabling others to innovate, by publishing its data in bulk, machine-readable formats. This approach allows citizens to easily adapt government data for any desirable purpose using the latest technological tools, rather than relying on a single government-provided interface. Despite its benefits, government may refuse to publish adaptable data for a variety of reasons. Such is the case with the U.S. Courts, which maintain a harmful paywall policy that limits access to electronic court records. We describe our pursuit to change the Courts&apos; policies through the development of the RECAP browser extension, which we built to liberate records from the Courts&apos; online access system. We analyze how RECAP&apos;s core design features contributed to its widespread adoption, and impacted the policy discourse. But even where government data are readily available, they may still be difficult to comprehend. We study how the U.S. Congress&apos; age-old legislative process hinders the development of automated software with immense efficiency and transparency benefits. We outline the steps that Congress would need to take to modernize its process and embrace these improvements. Finally, we discuss how recent &quot;open government&quot; policies have blurred the distinction between political and technological openness. We propose a clearer framing that separates the politics of public accountability from the technologies of open data, which we hope will make both ideals easier to achieve.

				"dc:description" : "A challenge facing community colleges nationwide is to reduce the carbon footprint of campuses by initiating green technology initiatives. This case study assessed the effect of switching from paper assignments to a learning management system at ABC Community College. The topic is important because federal and state funding, as well as accreditation, is partially based on decreasing the college&apos;s carbon footprint. Theoretical support for this investigation was developed from studies on learning management systems and green technology initiatives. Data collection involved interviews with 10 students, 10 faculty, and 10 staff members of ABC Community College. The themes and patterns that emerged from conversations related to collaboration, culture, decision-making, education, expectations, motivation, policy, resources, and technology. Each theme connected to the accessibility of this green technology initiative by the participant, whether it was as student, faculty or staff. Most participants believed environmental factors exceeded social and economic factors as the perception for the selection of this green technology initiative. Environmental factors may have a profound positive effect on green technology initiatives based on these perceptions. Implications include the ability to successfully implement and adapt green technology initiatives. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

				"dc:description" : "Administrators, teachers, and paraprofessionals play an important role in successful outcomes for students with special needs. Post-secondary training does not guarantee that emphasis is put on how each professional entity maintains the ability to collaborate with one another, and how to determine what continued training is pertinent for each of these team members. A researcher-developed instrument was used to assess how paraprofessionals, teachers, and administrators perceived the quality of their preservice, staff development, and collaborative practices. Descriptive and inferential questions addressed each of these three categories. One-way analyses of variance were used to detect significant discrepancies between groups. All results were taken from a five-point scale where 1.00-2.49 was of low quality, 2.50-3.49 was of moderate quality, and 3.50-5.00 was recorded as high quality. Of the approximately 154 respondents in the category of preservice, only 40.3% reported being exposed to a training module on how to collaborate among paraprofessionals, special education teachers, and paraprofessionals. The composite mean for all preservice items was 2.73, indicating that the preservice opportunities were of moderate quality. There were no significant differences in how the various groups perceived the quality of preservice opportunities, F(2, 156) = 1.01, p = 0.36. Paraprofessional respondents rated their professional development regarding training and modeling strategies to be of moderate quality (M = 2.90). Administrators and teachers perceived the modeling to train paraprofessionals (M = 2.49) to be of low quality. The composite mean for all professional development items was 2.69, indicating that professional development opportunities were perceived as moderate quality. There were no significant differences in how the groups perceived the quality of professional development opportunities, F(2, 145) = 1.60, p = 0.21. The composite mean for all collaborative practices items was 3.11, indicating collaborative practices were of moderate quality. There were no significant differences in how the groups perceived the quality of collaborative practices, F(2, 134) = 0.40, p = 0.67. The study poses some questions on how educational institutions are preparing and continue to train educators at different capacities.

				"dc:description" : "Despite the attention being paid to the achievement gap of minorities, the regulations and laws being enacted, the research being conducted, and the funding made available to narrow the achievement gap, there is evidence that shows it still exists for American Indians. This study examined the effects of Reading Recovery, an early literacy intervention, on the achievement gap of American Indians and their non- American Indian peers. Reading Recovery data from a training center encompassing a five state region were analyzed to determine the effects on the achievement gap. Two subtasks of the Observation Survey of Early Literacy Achievement were used to measure achievement at the beginning and end of the first-grade year of American Indian and non-American Indian students who had participated in Reading Recovery. Results of t tests of the mean scores in the fall indicated that the American Indians scored lower than the non-American Indians on both tasks. Differences in fall scores between groups were accounted for by adjusting spring scores using analyses of covariance. Differences in adjusted mean spring scores between the two groups were not statistically significant except for one subtest in one year out of the five years studied, showing that Reading Recovery narrowed or eliminated the gap for both American Indian and non-American Indians. Both groups started in the below average range in the fall and were at the average range in the spring after an intervention of 20 weeks or less. Students who start behind must experience accelerated learning in order to catch up with their peers and reach the average of their class. While both groups experienced accelerated learning, the American Indian students actually accelerated at a faster pace than their non-American Indian peers as evidenced in their higher spring mean scores and adjusted mean scores on one or the other of the subtasks during four of the five years studied. This study examined two groups that narrowed the achievement gap and compared how alike/different their journeys were. This adds to the research base confirming positive benefits of Reading Recovery with minority students (Batten, 2004; Rodgers, Wang, &amp; Gomez-Bellenge, 2004). Reading Recovery helps close the achievement gap of minority and majority students and the gap between them.

				"dc:description" : "Students invest a great deal of time, effort, and capital to obtain the MBA credential that they believe will provide them with the skills necessary to succeed in business. They expect such skills to position them for better job opportunities, salary increases, and a faster track to promotion up the corporate ladder. It is an investment that should yield rewards. However, the value of an MBA is open to skepticism by some. Critics have questioned the appropriateness of the skills that have become part of the typical curriculum and the ability of business programs to keep pace with a changing business environment. While students continue to believe in the value of the MBA, there is little current evidence to determine if the perception of employers toward its value has changed. Historical evidence demonstrates negative bias by some employers toward non-traditional degrees, such as those offered by online programs, due to a perception of student isolation and lack of collaboration in the online learning community. As technology advances and some of these perception issues are addressed, the lines between traditional and non-traditional program formats have become blurred. Consequently, demand for online programs, and the flexibility that they offer, has been strong. There is recent evidence that the public is more accepting of the non-traditional programs. This investigation was designed to expand the learning environment knowledge base. Employers and MBA graduates were queried on the importance and mastery of skills necessary in the workplace, the environment, traditional and non-traditional, and the rewards. The goal was to ascertain how the MBA is currently valued, and how the choice of program has met expectations. Using a cross-sectional survey design employing a questionnaire, alumni of MBA programs and employers were surveyed. Both groups identified problem solving, communication, and decision-making as the most essential skills that MBAs should bring to the workplace, and mastery of those skills was generally viewed as positive. Online learning was viewed positively, although employers continue to prefer on-campus learning. The role of technology was viewed by alumni as enhancing the online experience by facilitating interactivity. Overall, most were positive about the MBA experience and its rewards, but were less enthusiastic about the cost-benefit.

				"dc:description" : "This study examines how adult education can facilitate learning towards the full realization of human potential. It synthesizes two theories of human development, and applies this to the practice of community-based adult education carried out by trained facilitators who do not have formal degrees in the field of mental health. The first part of the methodology used modified analytic induction to carry out a synthesis between the works of William Hatcher (1935-2005) and Roberto Assagioli (1888-1974). The second part of the methodology works with the goals, principles, and practices which emerged from the lens&quot; provided by this synthesis, and applies these to an analysis of the Integrated and Systemic Community Therapy (CT) approach to community-based adult education, in Brazil. The impetus for this study was a desire to move beyond limitations of the humanistic orientation in adult education towards a more holistic theory, which draws on and combines both scientific and spiritual views of human reality. The study theorizes that learning which supports the full realization of human nature should actively seek to a) foster a person's ability to take action in the &quot;outer world&quot; of human social relations (interpersonal dimension) while b) aligning one's &quot;inner world&quot; (intrapersonal dimension) with an emerging implicate order, which is the origin of the structure of reality. Based on its relevance to the expanding Community Therapy approach the conclusion of the study is that the &quot;lens&quot; of a synthesis deserves to be applied and explored further.

				"dc:description" : "Framed within a Sociocultural Theory of Mind (SCT) in the field of Second Language Acquisition (Lantolf &amp; Thorne, 2006), this dissertation explores the role of verbalizing in the internalization of grammatical categories through the use of Concept-based Instruction (henceforth CBI) in the second language (L2) classroom. Using Vygotsky&apos;s (1986) distinction between scientific and spontaneous or everyday concepts applied to L2 development (Negueruela, 2008), this study focuses on the teaching and potential development of the grammatical concept of aspect in the Spanish L2 classroom, and the role of verbalizing in its internalization. It is proposed that verbalizing mediates between the learners&apos; initial understandings of the grammatical concept of aspect, the development of conscious conceptualizations, and students&apos; written and oral production of preterite and imperfect grammatical forms. This study presents and analyzes data from one of the thirty-two adult college students enrolled in an advanced Spanish conversation course. Data is analyzed through a clinical analytic approach, which has its roots in Vygotsky&apos;s (1978) genetic method of analysis. The study was carried out over a 12-week period and collected multiple sets of developmental data, including learners&apos; definition of the grammatical concept of aspect, written performance protocols, and verbalization data recorded during two oral interviews. The study interprets learner performance in these three complementary, and dialectically connected types of L2 conceptual data. A close analysis of this participant&apos;s data provides critical insights to understand the role of verbalizing in L2 conceptual development. Findings confirm that learners&apos; verbalizations are key factors to ascertain L2 conceptual development, as well as a mediational tool that fosters learners&apos; internalization of the grammatical concept of aspect. It is proposed that verbalizing notably contributes to research on L2 development. Not only does it allow the researcher to have a more comprehensive picture of L2 development, but it also helps learners develop a more sophisticated semantic understanding of the grammatical concept of aspect and fosters their ability to understand and control relevant grammatical features in L2 communication.

				"dc:description" : "Although public school teaching by its inherent nature presents numerous classroom challenges, the public high school teacher today is faced in addition with multiple external mandates from several outside stakeholders. Given the established track record of professional learning communities (PLCs) to provide teacher support and development, I created a PLC that would serve as an intervention designed to support teachers in their classroom work and with their multiple mandates as well. This enhanced PLC was informed by interviews with administrators, researched best practices of traditional PLCs, and uniquely, by what teachers told me they needed in an optimal PLC experience. The PLC was facilitated and based on inclusive, holistic social justice principles that provided a framework for and experience of inclusive teaching practice, while specifically addressing ongoing teacher concerns and issues raised by the multiple mandates. The PLC intervention I designed was for participants only, and I studied them along a range of outcomes that were compared to a control group of teachers identified from the same general population, but who did not experience the intervention. I used a multiple methods, predominantly qualitative approach, that included closed and open field questions taken before and after the intervention. I concluded by conducting in-depth end of term interviews with the participants in the intervention, enriched by my own field notes and observations. Findings included participants unanimously reporting this PLC uniquely satisfying, both professionally and personally. Professionally, they reported a significant gain across a range of knowledge, skills, self efficacy, and classroom management; an enhanced understanding of student diversity, and of the complex interactions between their choices of pedagogy and curriculum within the learning experience between and among students and teacher-leading to more effective professional interactions. After closely examining a published holistic teaching and learning model, participants exercised their professional power by creating one organizing tool to help them personalize and connect the apparently disparate mandates, and another organizer that schematically designed their future professional development requirements. Post-PLC, participants felt affirmed, empowered, less stressed, more closely affiliated, and spiritually supported by the PLC. Many continue to meet since the study&apos;s conclusion.

				"dc:description" : "This dissertation examines the strategic practice of virtual racial embodiment, as a case study of African Americans attempting to complicate current constructions of race and social justice in new media. I suggest that dominant racial constructions online teeter between racial stereotypes and the absence of race. Virtual racial classification and racial stereotypes of criminality and limited interaction with communication technologies prevalent in the digital divide literature frame the dominant online culture, which purports a Universalist ideal that avoids race through which racial hierarchy is nevertheless articulated. Based on qualitative and quantitative analyses--fieldwork, interviews with Black website founders, and an online survey--this case study provides an analytical framework that situates African Americans&apos; negotiations of race within everyday online discourse. I suggest that the strategy of racial embodiment has a sociohistorical and cultural basis in the racial and political strategies of offline African American communities. This study approaches these matters by locating political message board members&apos; agency in creating a safe space for daily critical discussions of race. Virtual safe spaces allow users to address social injustices, parse popular constructions of race, project respectability, and explore complex definitions of blackness. Ethnographic material drawn from the observation of four mainstream Black websites&apos; political message boards within the time frame of 2007-2008 provides information to discuss the unofficial message board practices I identify as safe house practices. I introduce the conceptual metaphor of safe house based on the physical and symbolic safe house of enslaved Africans of the antebellum era and their twentieth- and twenty-first-century successors--neighborhood meeting places, barbershops, and book stores. As a result of the analysis of the ethnographic material, I suggest racial embodiment is the transference of offline practices steeped in historic political and cultural practices of the Black community into online interactions. I use the Bourdieuan concept of the habitus to conceptualize the historical significance of the African American community&apos;s virtual racial embodiment. I propose that this racial embodiment evidenced in the safe house practices exemplifies a dynamic Black habitus wherein black people exercise the ability to redefine black identity and community.

				"dc:description" : "This study examined how interagency collaboration occurs within one local transition community of practice using Wenger's (1998) social theory of learning. While postschool outcomes of youth with disabilities have improved moderately, there continue to be many barriers based upon changes in American society, including the diversity of the population, family structures, legislation, policy, and practice (Newman, Wagner, Cameto, Knokey, &amp; Shaver, 2010). This situation occurs despite legislative mandates for multiple public agencies to provide &quot;transition services&quot; (IDEA, 2004). Studies show that fragmentation and duplication of supports and services negatively impact the outcomes of youth with disabilities (National Council on Disability, 2008), and research in the field of secondary transition over 30 years has identified the importance of interagency collaboration (Kochhar-Bryant, 2008). Research has shown that communities of practice--based on the social theory of learning, wherein participants collaborate to cross boundaries and solve complex issues (Snyder, Wenger, &amp; Briggs, 2003)--are a context for effective collaboration (Wenger, McDermott, &amp; Snyder, 2002). A qualitative, exploratory study was used to answer the research question: &quot;How do the four components of Wenger's (1998) social theory of learning act as the mechanisms for interagency collaboration in one local transition community of practice?&quot; These components are learning as doing (practice), learning as experience (meaning), learning as belonging (community), and learning as becoming (identity); the cyclical, iterative exchanges between the components create the dynamic of learning by collaborators. The unit of analysis was a unique case called the Local County Transition Coordinating Council, a local community of practice in the Mid-Atlantic region. The data of this study strongly support and describe the role of the four components of the social theory of learning as mechanisms for interagency collaboration in this one local transition community of practice, as well as the iterative exchange creating the dynamic of learning. Two emerging codes also acted as mechanisms for interagency collaboration, adaptation/change and leadership. Further research to explore the role of the social theory of learning through communities of practice as a context for interagency collaboration within secondary transition is warranted based on the findings of this study.

				"dc:description" : "This dissertation proposes a model of word stress in a derivational version of Optimality Theory (OT) called Harmonic Serialism (HS; Prince and Smolensky 1993/2004, McCarthy 2000, 2006, 2010a). In this model, the metrical structure of a word is derived through a series of optimizations in which the &quot;best&quot; metrical foot is chosen according to a ranking of violable constraints. Like OT, HS models cross-linguistic typology under the assumption that every constraint ranking should correspond to an attested language. Chapter 2 provides an argument for modeling stress typology in HS by showing that the serial model correctly rules out stress patterns that display non-local interactions, while a parallel OT model with the same constraints and representations fails to make such a distinction. Chapter 3 discusses two types of primary stress--autonomous and parasitic--and argues that limited parallelism in the assignment of primary stress is warranted by a consideration of attested typology. Stress systems in which the primary stress appears to behave autonomously from secondary stresses require that primary stress assignment be simultaneous with a foot&apos;s construction. As a result, a provision to allow primary stress to be reassigned during a derivation is necessary to account for a class of stress systems in which primary stress is parasitic on secondary stresses. Chapter 4 takes up two issues in the definition of constraints on primary stress, including a discussion of how primary stress alignment should be formulated and the identification of vacuous satisfaction as a cause of problematic typological predictions. It is proposed that all primary stress constraints be redefined according to non-vacuous schemata, which eliminate the problematic predictions when implemented within HS. Finally, chapter 5 considers the role of representational assumptions in typological predictions with comparisons between HS and parallel OT. The primary conclusion of this chapter is that constituent representations (i.e., feet) are necessary in HS to account for rhythmic stress patterns in a typologically restrictive way.

				"dc:description" : "In July of 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) determined that Massachusetts had violated the civil rights of its English Language Learners (ELLs) by placing them in classes with inadequately prepared teachers. Massachusetts is the contextual background for this study but it also serves as an example of the challenges across the U.S. in preparing teachers to meet the diverse needs of the growing population of ELLs within a national context of increasingly standardized curriculum and testing. The U.S. Secretary of Education, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Education, policy makers, teacher educators, and academics are all looking to educational research for answers to the current challenges. There are many answers or approaches coming from multiple discourses of educational research. However, as has been demonstrated in Massachusetts, research-based approaches to educational challenges are not always successful. More needs to be understood about how these approaches are actually taken up in classrooms. Unfortunately, there is limited research about teachers' understandings and uses of different discourses of research. In this dissertation I have explored how two urban ESL teachers engaged with research at different stages of their professional development. The questions that guide this study focused on how the teachers made meaning of research and enacted research during the three stages of the study: their master's program, their ESL practicum and a site visit two years after graduation. I conducted two longitudinal case studies drawing on constructivist grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006). Building on the findings from my literature review of ESL teachers' engagement with research I collected and analyzed data from the three stages mentioned above over a five-year period. Multiple phases of analysis included critical incident analysis (Angelides, 2001), and text analysis (Fairclough, 1992; 2003; Janks, 2005). The findings of this study show that while the teachers engaged in multiple ways with research, certain types and discourses of research discouraged teachers from meeting the needs of their students. The teachers' engagement with research as praxis (Lather, 1986) was complex but entailed change-enhancing engagement with theory, practice, and action that not only met students' needs, but promoted socially just teaching.

				"dc:description" : "This dissertation explores the interplay of grammar and context in the interpretation of modal words like &quot;ought,&quot; &quot;necessary,&quot; and &quot;need.&quot; The empirical foci of the discussion are patterns in the use of strong and weak necessity modals in conversation, and the interpretation of syntactically and semantically versatile modals like &quot;need&quot; in the various grammatical configurations they appear in across languages. It is argued that a sensitivity to collective commitments in a conversation is necessary for understanding certain aspects of modal strength, in particular the traditional distinction between strong and weak necessity modals (exhibited by &quot;must&quot; and &quot;ought to&quot; in English). It is proposed that strong necessity modals can only reference priorities that are presupposed to be collectively committed to, whereas weak necessity modals are evaluated with respect to a mixed bag of priorities, crucially including ones that are presupposed not to be collectively committed to. A domain restriction approach to weak necessity is adopted, following a demonstration that it is superior to a number of probabilistic alternatives. Modal verbs and adjectives that take both infinitival and nominal complements are shown to pattern alike across languages in requiring a teleological, or goal-oriented interpretation when their complements are not infinitives (but rather noun phrases or certain Complementizer Phrases). This limitation is lifted with infinitival complements, showing that transitive configurations of certain intensional verbs are not semantically equivalent to the infinitival configurations of the same verbs. A result of this research is a fine grained analysis of the differences between closely related necessity modals and attitude verbs.

				"dc:description" : "Despite the push for universal education, many disadvantaged and poor children in developing countries still do not have access to basic education. This among other reasons is due to poverty where poor families cannot afford the cost of basic education even when it is &quot;free&quot; of tuition (McDonald, 2007). Demand-side financing interventions such as scholarship programs are promising to be viable financing interventions of reaching out to the poor and marginalized children in order for them to access basic education. Although such financing strategies have been praised as having worked in mostly Latin American countries, very little is systematically known about how these interventions would work in poor African countries such as Malawi. This study therefore examines demand-side financing strategy through an evaluation of a scholarship program implemented in Malawi. It uses qualitative mode of inquiry through in-depth interviews of 36 key participants as a primary method of data collection. In addition it reviews program documents and conducts some cohort tracking on beneficiaries in Zomba rural district which is the site of the study. The findings show that community based targeting was used in the program and proved successful in identifying the right beneficiaries in a cost effective manner. It seems to offer a model to be adopted for such interventions in low resource countries. Findings further show that beneficiaries who received scholarships were able to persist however there was a substantial number that dropped out. There were a number of factors that caused this but it seems the internal motivation of beneficiaries to persist was very critical. This puts under the microscope an assumption that once scholarship is received, beneficiaries would persist in school. Last but not least, the findings also show that an assumption that local communities will be able to sustain such programs might be but a mere illusion as communities view themselves too poor to do this. Overall the study praises such programs as effective in targeting the poor and marginalized children however it puts a caution on assumptions about persistence &amp; sustainability. It suggests further scrutiny on these assumptions to improve on the effectiveness of such programs and demand-side financing strategies in general.

				"dc:description" : "Decades of reading research have improved our understanding of the ways that young children learn how to read and of the component skills that support the ongoing development of reading and reading comprehension. But while these investments have transformed reading instruction and reading outcomes for many learners, too many children are not reading at the basic level nor are they reading with understanding. The Institute of Education Sciences created the Reading for Understanding Research Initiative in 2010 to fund a set of connected projects that would enrich the theoretical frameworks that undergird efforts to improve deep comprehension and to design and test new interventions and assessments to improve reading for understanding across all grades in U.S. schools. This article describes the central themes that guided the design of the Reading for Understanding Initiative and the work underway by the six research teams funded under this program.

The study utilized a partnership model whereby the evaluators worked collaboratively with primary stakeholders (school administrators) to determine areas of focus for the evaluation. The program evaluation was conducted between August 2009 and August 2010, spanning one school year. The evaluation participants were the school&apos;s teachers. The evaluation was based on an exploratory case study design and included both quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative data consisted of direct observations of treatment adherence to behavior plans in classrooms, teacher knowledge of treatment content assessed in quizzes, and observations of teacher engagement with students at recess. Qualitative data consisted of teacher surveys and focus groups. The evaluation yielded an in-depth assessment of treatment integrity within the school; an intervention to define and enhance teacher engagement during recess was also developed and implemented.

				"dc:description" : "The purpose of this study was to determine K-12 teachers' knowledge, beliefs, and practices of brain-based learning strategies in western Pennsylvania schools. The following five research questions were explored: (a) What is the extent of knowledge K-12 public school teachers have about the indicators of brain-based learning and Brain Gym?; (b) To what extent do K-12 public school teachers rate the value of brain-based learning and Brain Gym?; (c) To what extent do K-12 public school teachers report implementing brain-based learning indicators in their classrooms?; (d) What is the relationship between K-12 public school teachers' level of knowledge of brain-based learning and indicators of Brain Gym and their beliefs about brain-based learning?; (e) What is the relationship between gender, years of teaching experience, grade level being taught, and teachers' knowledge, perceptions, and implementation related to brain-based learning? The participants (N = 256) included in this study consisted of K-12 public school teachers within three selected school districts in western Pennsylvania. The data was collected by using the Brain-Based Learning Survey Questionnaire (BBLSQ), developed by Shelley Klinek (2009), and was administered electronically using an online survey software program called Qualtrics. The survey was designed to measure participants' knowledge, beliefs, and practices of brain-based learning strategies. The results of the study indicate that teacher's knowledge of learning strategies are related to their beliefs about those strategies, as well as their instructional practices. It was further determined that teachers had positive attitudes towards learning new strategies; they feel it is important to demonstrate and show educators new ways of teaching; and they feel the need to be more adequately trained in the area of how the brain learns best. This study indicates that teachers are interested in how students learn best, and are willing to change their teaching practices to improve the learning process.

				"dc:description" : "One public school district developed a full-day kindergarten program for at-risk students, including those who are limited English-proficient (LEP), as a strategy to close the achievement gap. Not all LEP students in this district attended the full-day program due to limited space. The district administrators were looking for research-based evidence on the effectiveness of this 4-year old program to determine if the program should shift to a universal, full-day kindergarten program. The purpose of this quantitative, post facto design study was to examine the effect of attending a full-day and a half-day kindergarten program and the duration of this effect on the reading scores of LEP students over 4 academic years. Vygotsky's theory of constructivism provided the framework for this study. The difference between the reading scores of LEP students at the end of 4 consecutive academic years for LEP students who attended a full-day and a half-day kindergarten were compared. The sample included N = 78 LEP kindergarten students. Results from independent t tests and Kruskal-Wallis tests confirmed no significant difference between the means of the 2 groups across all 4 academic years. No short- or long-term effect has been found of the full-day kindergarten program. Recommendations for the district are to look for strategies other than the full-day program to increase the reading achievement of LEP students. Implications for positive social change include providing educators and researchers with information that can result in increased reading achievement for LEP students.

				"dc:description" : "The protection of proprietary information that users print from their information systems is a significant and relevant concern in the field of information security to both researchers and practitioners. Information security researchers have repeatedly indicated that human behaviors and perception are important factors influencing the information security of organizations and have called for more research. The aerospace and defense industry commonly deals with its own proprietary information as well its customers. Further, e-training is a growing practice in this industry, it frequently deals with proprietary information, and has unique information security challenge, thus, serves as additional context for this study. This study focused on the investigation of two constructs, user reading preference and user perceived risk of compromising printed proprietary information, as well as seven user demographics. These constructs reflect human behavior and risk perceptions associated with compromising printed proprietary information and, thus, provide valuable insights applicable into information security. This study developed a Reading Preference and Risk (RPR) Taxonomy, which allows users to be classified according to the aforementioned two constructs under investigation and provides insightful characterizations of information security risks. A survey based on existing literature, the primary constructs, and several demographics was implemented to assess two research questions and seven associated hypotheses. The survey was sent to 1,728 employees of an aerospace and defense organization. The response rate was 18% with 311 usable records. The results of the study showed that employees were dispersed across the RPR Taxonomy with 15.1% identified as potentially problematic to the protection of printed proprietary information. The overall results showed that the population had a reading preference for print materials and a high perceived risk for compromising printed proprietary information, as well as significantly higher print preference for e-training materials when it was necessary to retain the content in memory. Significant differences in the two constructs were also found across several demographics including age, gender, frequency of user exposure to proprietary information, the confidentiality level of the proprietary information a user is regularly exposed to, and previous user experience with the compromise of proprietary information. Recommendations for practice and research are provided. Moreover, several areas for future research are also presented.

				"dc:description" : "The study examined the relationship between leader-member exchange (LMX) and individual objective performance. While the LMX literature suggests a positive correlation between LMX and performance, a closer look at the research examined showed that the performance measurements were based on subjective measurements rather than objective measurements. Literature examining the effect on objective measurements is lacking. To determine the effect LMX has on objective measures of performance and to expand the LMX research literature, this theory was applied in a freshmen business learning community within higher education. Literature from four areas (LMX, performance, learning communities, and mentoring) provided the theoretical framework. Individual objective performance measures were collected for each student of the study population (N = 593) from institutional records. Participants were asked to assess the relationship quality with the peer leaders assigned to them using a modified version of the LMX-MDM (Liden &amp; Maslyn, 1998). A correlational data analysis was run for the number of respondents (n = 88) in regard to peer leader-student LMX (independent variable) and three individual objective performance measures: Mid-term GPA (H[subscript 0] 1), Term GPA (H[subscript 0] 2), and first year grade exclusion, or FYGE (H[subscript 0] 3). No significant support was found establishing any correlation between the independent variable (LMX) and the dependent variables (individual objective performance measures). Overall, the findings of the study were inconclusive due to the small sample size, and recommendations regarding future replication studies and further advancement of LMX research literature is presented.

The purpose of this study was to illuminate the impact of Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) Academy programs on students&apos; academic performance. The theoretical foundation of the research was based on Bronfenbrenner&apos;s ecological system theory, which holds that a child&apos;s environment can affect his or her development and success. A pretest-posttest nonequivalent control group design was employed to compare the biology and literature End of Course Test (EOCT) scores for 9th grade JROTC students and students from a traditional small school learning community. Research questions determined if there were significant differences between the groups&apos;s biology and literature EOCT scores, controlling for differences in pretest scores. Data were analyzed using Analysis of Covariance. Significant differences were found between JROTC academy students&apos; and traditional students&apos; EOCT biology scores. These results suggest that the JROTC academy concept might be useful in other urban environments with a high percentage of at-risk students. Positive social change could occur from this study by informing educators of the utility of the Junior ROTC academy concept for enhancing students&apos; social development and academic achievement.

				"dc:description" : "Teen motherhood is a problem in the United States, resulting in higher drop-out rates, lower GPAs, and worse attendance rates than for female teens without children. To address issues that teen mothers face, the California Department of Education implemented the Cal-SAFE program; however, budget cuts have closed many of the Cal-SAFE sites. While a full-scale assessment was conducted on Cal-SAFE's overall statewide program in 2010, the child care portion of the program was not researched with respect to GPA, attendance rates, and graduation rates. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the Cal-SAFE program's child care services and its effect on attendance rates, GPAs, and graduation rates of teen mothers. Social support theories provided the framework for this study, specifically demonstrating the importance of providing support services for teen mothers enrolled in a Cal-SAFE program. Research questions addressed differences in attendance rates, GPAs, and graduation rates between teen mothers who used Cal-SAFE's child care services and those who did not. A between-group analysis of variance as well as a chi square analysis was used to analyze data from 118 Cal-SAFE participants who either used or who did not use the child care services. Mothers who used child care services had significantly higher attendance rates and significantly higher GPAs than mothers who did not use the services. Similarly, mothers who used child care services had significantly higher graduates rates than mothers who did not use the services. Implications for social change include providing research-based data on the efficacy of the Cal-SAFE child care program to decision makers, both within and outside of California; implementation of Cal-SAFE's philosophy in other programs may, in turn improve educational outcomes for teen mothers.

				"dc:description" : "In 1997, based on the amendments to Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), all states were faced with a statutory requirement to develop and implement alternate assessments for students with disabilities unable to participate in the statewide large-scale assessment. States were given the challenge of creating, implementing, and executing these tests within a short period of three years. In most cases, innovative assessments were developed by tweaking, combining and modifying traditional assessments already in place for non-disabled students. When changes were made to the traditional assessment program, the psychometric properties associated with the test and scores are likely to differ due to the unique characteristics of the student population and testing program. However, few changes had been made to the traditional analyses of scores of students with disabilities. This study examines the impact of changes to three psychometric elements--design, examinee population and analysis issues on ability and item estimates from the assessment computed using Rasch measurement model. Using data from a statewide selected response alternate assessment designed for students with disabilities in southern United States, the impact of test design and analysis decisions related to partial credit scoring, analyses within homogeneous groups and treatment of lead questions were examined to determine the effect on test outcomes. We examined estimates of item difficulty and ability as well as a select sample of items and students' scores to compare them to estimates from &quot;original&quot; analyses. The results indicated considerable variability of student scores and differential impacts on item measures based on the choices or a combination of choices made during analyses. Clear patterns of change in scores when the lead questions were treated as correct seem to suggest a systemic change in item measures. High correlations between student scores from the homogeneous and the heterogeneous group analyses indicated little difference between the two. The findings in this study provided evidence for building validity evidence for an assessment, decisions made in computing psychometric measures need to be explicitly based on theory and aligned to the use and the interpretations of scores.

				"dc:description" : "Federal mandates require technology use in the classroom, but not all English language arts (ELA) teachers have implemented technology as an integral part of teaching. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to investigate why ELA teachers in 2 local high schools rarely or never use technology as an instructional tool. The study was supported by theories of constructivism, multiple intelligences, and problem-based learning. The guiding research questions sought to explore teachers&apos; perspectives regarding integrating technology within the ELA curriculum. Qualitative data were collected via face-to-face interviews, field notes from classroom visits, and unobtrusive documents which included lesson plans and check-out logs for equipment from 8 participants. Open coding was used as themes emerged during the data analysis. A qualitative typological analysis was used to analyze individual cases, and a cross-case analysis clustered themes from participants&apos; interview responses. Findings suggested teachers&apos; limited use of technology resulted from inadequate access to equipment, inability to troubleshoot minor technology problems, and the absence of training in learning activities. The project included professional development training sessions focused on technology use as a teaching tool. Recommendations include initiating opportunities for teachers to demonstrate proficiency in embedding technology as a pivotal teaching strategy in all disciplines. By providing effective technology training and embedding technology in instruction, students may be better prepared to compete in the technological society of the 21st century and global workforce.

				"dc:description" : "Substantial changes to the undergraduate population at US universities have created a need for the development of a model of academic literacy and a corresponding means of measuring academic readiness that addresses contextualized, communicative English language competence. This paper presents a unified model of academic literacy which treats language competence and academic writing skills within a single contextualized framework. This model was then used to develop a writing assessment which evaluates writing products written by both native and non-native speaking populations within an undergraduate required English course. Academic literacy refers to the attainment of the communicative competence required for the student to gain membership in the university discourse community. As a construct which requires membership within the academic discourse community, academic literacy entails communicative competence. Researchers have found that academic writing is primarily composed of tasks which engage students with existing information and ask them to respond critically in a way that demonstrates learning (Hinkel, 2009). The unified model takes into account the central nature of these kinds of writing tasks to university success. A program completion task was developed with respect to the established criteria based on the unified model. Successful completion of the exit task confirms that the student is able to meet the academic writing demands typically encountered in US university coursework; the assessment addresses language competence and effective implementation of academic writing skills as defined by the common core state standards initiative for ELA and repeated in required university English course curricula. In other words, the exit task evaluated by the established assessment criteria determines whether the student exhibits academic readiness, a construct which addresses situated communicative competence. The assessment was validated and determined to be a reliable tool for assessing academic readiness of native and non-native speakers of English, informing decisions to promote students to academic study.

				"dc:description" : "This study sought to find evidence for a beneficial learning theory to teach computer software programs. Additionally, software was analyzed for each learning theory&apos;s applicability to resolve whether certain software requires a specific method of education. The results are meant to give educators more effective teaching tools, so students ultimately get the most out of any particular software program. The study&apos;s value comes from additional significant information added to the established constructivist and instructivist debate, which is important to psychologists and educators. The design of the study was a randomized quantitative experiment with an analysis of covariance design employing four groups, gathered using convenience sampling, in a pretest, posttest model to analyze multiple independent variables. Further design parameters included a 2 X 2 Factorial Design, 0.05 significance, large post hoc Cohen f effect size for learning theory, and 89% power. The sample was 167 students enrolled in Digital Image Manipulation, Digital Layout, Digital Illustration, or Digital Typography classes during two quarters of 2012. The participants were analyzed in their normal classroom environment using an online test/lesson/test exercise. The instrument was Photoshop CS5 and InDesign CS5 uCertify Adobe Certified Expert (ACE) exam preparation guides. Research Question 1 stated: Is constructivist or behavioral learning theory more beneficial when teaching multimedia software? A significant finding for Research Question 1 indicates a difference between the learning theories behaviorism and constructivism. The behaviorist group scored higher than the constructivist group. Research Question 2 stated: Is there a difference in the effectiveness of learning between Photoshop and InDesign when teaching multimedia software? There was no significant finding for Research Question 2; therefore, no difference was found between Photoshop and InDesign. Research Question 3 stated: Are there interactions between learning theory and software with regards to teaching multimedia software? No interaction was found between learning theory and software. According to the current study, teachers who instruct their courses through a problem-based constructivist method should consider a behaviorist approach. A behavioral learning curriculum is especially important if the class is instructing Adobe software. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

				"dc:description" : "The purpose of this reputation-based, multiple-site case study was to explore professional learning communities' impact on teacher classroom practice. The goal of this research was to describe the administrator and teachers' perceptions with respect to professional learning communities as it related to teacher practice in their school. Educators and administrators were asked what types of practices teachers took from collaborative professional learning communities and tried in their classrooms. This reputation-based, multiple-site case study was important to Nebraska educators because many school districts had implemented professional learning communities in a variety of forms in the schools. There had been little, if any, investigation on what impact professional learning communities have had on teacher practice and the extent to which that had impacted students. This study focused on the teachers' perceptions of the impact professional learning communities had on their pedagogical practice as a result of collaboration and interactions in professional learning communities. This study involved three schools in one Midwestern school district. The schools and district had operated professional learning communities for 6 years. The researcher found that professional learning communities had impacted teacher practice in that teachers had changed what they do from a pedagogical standpoint, as a result of interactions and collaboration in professional learning communities. The extent to which teacher pedagogical practice had been impacted is open to judgment. The fact that teachers had positively changed their pedagogy as a result of professional learning community function, including collaboration and interactions in professional learning community groups, is not open to judgment, as that is the primary finding of this study.

The research study provided information on factors that influence school administrators' decisions to provide Pre-K programs. Demographic data was gathered from each participant so common group data, such as rural and non-rural disaggregated data, could be used to better analyze results and identify restrictions to implementation of Pre-K programs in schools and school districts. An explanatory, sequential, mixed methods study was conducted during the spring and summer of 2012. The study initially gathered data using an online survey sent to elementary principals and superintendents in all public school districts in Nebraska. Interviews with a selected sample of Nebraska elementary school principals and superintendents were conducted following the survey to expand on the data results gathered from the quantitative study.

				"dc:description" : "Research literature is full of research-based instructional strategies that highly effective teachers utilize on a consistent and systematic basis. And, it is well known that in multiple fields there exists a gap between what people know and what they actually do, commonly referred to as the knowing-doing gap. This study sought to examine whether this same gap exists in the field of education. In other words, this study sought to describe what high school mathematics, science, English, and social studies teachers know about effective instructional strategies and what they actually do in their classrooms. The researcher reviewed studies, books, journal articles, and other professional literature in order to identify what the most effective teachers know and ostensibly should do in their classrooms. The result was the identification of ten highly effective instructional strategies: learning objectives, accessing prior knowledge, delivery of new declarative information, delivery of new procedural information, application of new information, summarizing or generalizing, note taking, comparing similarities and differences, providing reinforcement or recognizing effort, and cooperative learning or small group work. From these ten strategies, the researcher developed a web-based survey designed to measure all ten of these strategies. High school mathematics, science, English, and social studies teachers were invited to participate in the study. From the survey three teachers expressed a desire to complete a follow-up interview and of those three, two completed the interview. The results indicated that there may be a gap between what teachers profess to know and what they actually do in their classrooms. Given these findings of what teachers know and what teachers do, the researcher recommends that teacher preparation courses, educational service units, and district level professional development focus on efforts to help close the teacher knowing-doing gap, and ultimately improve student learning.

				"dc:description" : "Virtual K-12 schools have rapidly become a popular choice for parents and students in the last decade. However, little research has been done on the instructional practices used in virtual courses. As reflected in the central research question, the purpose of this study was to explore how teachers provided instruction for Grade 7-10 students in both English language arts and science courses in a virtual school in a southern state. The conceptual framework was based on Piaget's theory of cognitive development and Garrison, Anderson, and Siemens' research on instructional design. The units of analysis in this qualitative, comparative case study were four virtual courses; the data were collected from teacher and student questionnaires, threaded student discussions, student work samples, and archival records. The first level of data analysis involved coding and categorization using the constant comparative method, and the second level involved examining the data for patterns, themes, and relationships to determine key findings. Results indicated that a standardized virtual course design supported teacher use of direct instruction and summative assessments and some individualized instruction to deliver course content, including adjusting the course pace, conducting individual telephone conferences, and providing small group instruction using Blackboard &quot;Elluminate.&quot; Opportunities for student interaction and inquiry learning were limited. This study is expected to contribute to positive social change by providing educators and policymakers with an awareness of the critical need for further study of research-based instructional practices in K-12 virtual courses that would improve student learning.
